Japan's financial regulators announced sweeping new measures to ban cryptocurrency insider trading, marking the country's most significant step yet toward treating digital assets like traditional securities. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) and Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) will submit proposed legislation to parliament in 2026 that would criminalize trading cryptocurrencies using non-public information and impose surcharges on violators based on their illicit gains.​

**Regulatory Framework Takes Shape**

The SESC will gain authority to investigate suspicious crypto trading activity and recommend financial penalties for insider trading violations, mirroring enforcement mechanisms used for traditional stock trading. The FSA plans to establish a working group by the end of 2025 to define specific actions that constitute cryptocurrency insider trading, including trading tokens before public exchange listing announcements or after learning of unreported security flaws.​

Under the proposed framework, offenders could face fines or criminal charges depending on violation severity. The regulations represent a fundamental shift from Japan's current approach, which relies primarily on self-regulation by exchanges and the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association.​

**Market Growth Drives Oversight Need**

Japan's cryptocurrency market has experienced explosive growth, with active trading accounts reaching 7.88 million users—representing about 6.3% of the population and a fourfold increase over five years. This rapid expansion has prompted regulators to address gaps in oversight, particularly the absence of insider trading rules under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act covering digital assets.​

The regulatory changes aim to restore trust and fairness in Japan's rapidly growing cryptocurrency market, where trading demand continues surging among local institutions like Nomura, which through its subsidiary Laser Digital is in early talks with the FSA to receive a crypto trading license. "We have to consider harsher punishments. The current penalties are way too light," said Shinsuke Amiya, a lawmaker examining insider trading regulations.​
