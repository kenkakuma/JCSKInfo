We won't have to wait too much longer to find out which game will follow the wonderful _Astro Bot_'s triumph at last year's edition of The Game Awards. The 2025 ceremony takes place [on December 11](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-game-awards-has-already-set-a-date-for-its-2025-show-155936829.html) at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. In between a cavalcade of video game trailers and announcements, the show will squeeze in some actual awards. We now know what the contenders for The Game Awards 2025 are after Monday's announcement of the nominees.

Those vying for the top prize of game of the year are:

*   [_Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-an-original-hit-rpg-090012488.html) \- Sandfall Interactive/Kepler Interactive
    
*   [_Death Stranding 2: On The Beach_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-22-minutes-of-death-stranding-2-gameplay-from-summer-games-fest-224814307.html) - Kojima Productions/Sony Interactive Entertainment
    
*   [_Donkey Kong Bananza_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendos-latest-3d-platformer-is-an-instant-classic-143048108.html) - Nintendo EPD/Nintendo
    
*   [_Hades II_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html) - Supergiant Games
    
*   [_Hollow Knight: Silksong_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-should-give-you-a-chance-against-its-early-bosses-134125593.html) - Team Cherry
    
*   _Kingdom Come: Deliverance II_ - Warhorse Studios/Deep Silver
    

Half of those are also up for game of the year at the [Indie Game Awards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/old-school-platforming-metroidvania-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000751.html). Those three games (_Clair Obscur, Hades II_ and _Hollow Knight: Silksong_) are up for the best independent game award at this ceremony as well, alongside [_Absolum_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/absolum-is-awesome-and-i-cant-wait-to-play-it-on-october-9-180037272.html)_,_ [_Ball x Pit_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html) and [_Blue Prince_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/every-puzzle-game-is-a-couch-co-op-game-actually-163024595.html)_._

With 12 nods in total — including three in the best performance category — _Clair Obscur_ isn’t just the most-nominated game this year. It’s the most-nominated game in the 12-year history of the ceremony. _Death Stranding 2_ and _Ghost of Yōtei_ have eight nods each, _Hades II_ has seven and _Silksong_ has five. Sony Interactive Entertainment leads the way among publishers with 19 nominations.

A whole bunch of high-profile games missed out on nominations for the main award. However, the likes of _Arc Raiders, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Mario Kart World, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Elden Ring: Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Split Fiction, Monster Hunter Wilds_ and _Silent Hill f_ have picked up nods in other categories. It’s neat to see games like _Consume Me,_ [_Despelote_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/despelote-review-a-poignant-memoir-masquerading-as-a-soccer-game-124526276.html)_, Rematch_ and _Dispatch_ pick up nominations this year too. Meanwhile, _Marvel’s Deadpool VR_, a game that isn’t even out until tomorrow, picked up a nod.

Fan voting for this year's edition of The Game Awards starts today on the [TGA website](https://thegameawards.com/). Public ballots account for 10 percent of the final vote, with a jury comprising dozens of media outlets accounting for the remaining 90 percent. The nominees for the players’ voice award — the only one determined entirely by fans — will be announced on December 1.

The Game Awards (which is [under fire](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards) over its handling of the discontinued Future Class program) will be streaming across a wide variety of platforms, including Prime Video for the first time. As ever, we'll be on top of all of the big news from the event, so stay tuned to Engadget for all the juicy details. Place your bets now on what will be announced. Maybe, just maybe, we'll get a glimpse of [_Half-Life 3_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html)?
