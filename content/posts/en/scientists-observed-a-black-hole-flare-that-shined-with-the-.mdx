It can be challenging for us humans to wrap our brains around really massive numbers. Even the scale of a million or billion is pretty hard for most people to really comprehend. So prepare yourself to think big, because scientists have recorded the largest and most distant black hole flare to date, and the numbers around it are pretty staggering. 

The event occurred at an active galactic nucleus, also known as an accreting or feeding black hole, that they predict is 500 million times more massive than our sun and is located 10 billion light years away. The researchers suspect that this flare was caused by a tidal disruption event, where the gravity of the AGN may have pulled a nearby star closer and consumed it. The team estimates that the star eaten by the black hole had a mass 30 times that of our system's own sun. And according to the layperson [blog post](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/black-hole-flare-is-biggest-and-most-distant-seen) from Caltech about the event, "at its brightest, the flare shined with the light of 10 trillion suns."

"This is unlike any AGN we've ever seen," said Matthew Graham, who was a co-principal investigator on the study as well as a research professor of astronomy at Caltech and project scientist for the Zwicky Transient Facility, which first observed the black hole in question in 2018 along with the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey. The research about the AGN and its bonkers flare appeared in the journal [_Nature Astronomy_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=0ae3b3e9-580a-443e-8c24-24917fb143d0&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Nature+Research&linkText=Nature+Astronomy&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3M0MTU1MC0wMjUtMDI2OTktMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGFlM2IzZTktNTgwYS00NDNlLThjMjQtMjQ5MTdmYjE0M2QwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3M0MTU1MC0wMjUtMDI2OTktMCJ9&signature=AQAAARkbdRToW5JM9M_fL5hyMqpahKwZ0KYU_MtJxPBjfqr2&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41550-025-02699-0).
