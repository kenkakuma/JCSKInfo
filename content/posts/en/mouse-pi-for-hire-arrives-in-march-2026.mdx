We finally have a release date for _Mouse: P.I. for Hire_. The delightfully animated game, which marks Troy Baker's first time playing a rodent private eye, is slated for March 19, 2026.

Based on its trailers, you'd be forgiven for viewing _Mouse: P.I. for Hire_ as _Cuphead_ meets _Doom_. Although it does include FPS action, Engadget's Jessica Conditt discovered [surprising depth behind its whimsical brutality](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-more-to-mouse-pi-for-hire-than-cartoon-violence-203044404.html). The game "has more to offer than shock-value cartoon violence," she wrote. "This is a clue-gathering, photo-snapping, girlfriend-avenging, noir detective simulator that happens to star a bunch of slick-talking mice and rats, and I'm fully into it."

Baker [plays Private Investigator Jack Pepper](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/troy-baker-is-the-big-cheese-in-mouse-pi-for-hire-220033867.html), the game's protagonist. When he isn't hunting clues or sneaking around during the game's quieter moments, he'll have a delightful arsenal on hand. This includes wacky ones like a turpentine gun that melts the inked "skin" of your foes. Fun stuff.

Like [_Cuphead_](https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-22-cuphead-hands-on.html), _Mouse_'s most obvious point of comparison, it uses hand-drawn frames to recreate that old-school style. It also deploys an original jazz soundtrack recorded by an orchestral ensemble. It's all presented in a gritty, film noir aesthetic.

You can check out the release date trailer below. _Mouse: P.I. for Hire_ will launch next March on PC, Switch 2, Switch, PS5/4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
