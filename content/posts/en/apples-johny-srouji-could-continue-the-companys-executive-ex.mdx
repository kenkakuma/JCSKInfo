Apple's Johny Srouji may be the latest company executive to seek greener pastures, according to a report from [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next). The report said that Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, told Tim Cook that he is "seriously considering leaving in the near future."

While the report didn't mention if Srouji has another job lined up, _Bloomberg_'s sources claimed that he wants to join another company if he leaves Apple. Srouji joined the company in 2008 to develop Apple's first in-house system-on-a-chip and eventually led the transition to Apple silicon.

If Srouji leaves Apple, he would be the latest in a string of departures of longtime execs. At the start of the month, Apple announced that [John Giannandrea](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/), the company's senior vice president for machine learning and AI strategy, would be retiring from his role in spring 2026. A couple of days later, [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true) reported that the company's head of interface design, Alan Dye, would be leaving for a role at Meta. Adding to those exits, Apple also [revealed](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-executive-transitions/) that Kate Adams, who has been Apple's general counsel since 2017, and Lisa Jackson, vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will both be leaving in early 2026.

The shakeup at the executive level comes after _Bloomberg_'s [Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8) previously reported that Cook may not be preparing for his own departure as CEO next year. Gurman's prediction counters a report from the _Financial Times_ that claimed that Apple was accelerating [succession plans](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-reportedly-getting-ready-to-replace-tim-cook-as-early-as-next-year-171407974.html) for Cook with an expected stepping down sometime next year.
