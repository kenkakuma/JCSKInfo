_Dave the Diver_, the smash hit adventure RPG/management hybrid, is finally available on Xbox. The game, about an intrepid scuba diver named Dave who splits his time between underwater adventuring and serving sushi in a local restaurant, started as a PC exclusive in 2023, but has since made its way to Switch, Switch 2, PS4 and PS5. Only Xbox remained, but it’s here now, along with all DLC released to date.

Since launch, developer Mintrocket has added to the lengthy base game campaign with a number of expansions, including a tie-in with fellow fishing game _Dredge_, and a [Godzilla](https://www.engadget.com/dave-the-diver-is-bringing-godzilla-with-him-to-ps5-this-spring-233136441.html) crossover. Ichiban Kasuga from the Like a Dragon series has also made an appearance in the Blue Hole, because why not? The upcoming 'Into the Jungle' DLC was [delayed](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dave-the-divers-in-the-jungle-dlc-may-not-arrive-until-2026-but-godzilla-is-back-203019821.html) to early 2026 back in the summer, but Mintrocket has given us a sneak peek at what it promises is _Dave the Diver_’s biggest expansion yet in a new trailer for the Xbox launch. The very meta trailer also shows Dave playing his own game on a [ROG Xbox Ally X](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html) while at sea. (Technically he could already have done that via Steam but it's still a nice touch.) 

If you haven’t played _Dave the Diver_ before, it’s almost impossible to do the game justice with a brief summary. The core loop sees you diving for fish during the day, which you obediently bring to the chef at the sushi joint you moonlight at for preparation. But that’s barely scratching the surface. The eponymous diver also battles sea monsters, runs errands for a secret underwater civilization and eventually manages his own farm. Not content with simply being an RPG and a management sim, _Dave the Diver_ is crammed with mini-games and genre diversions that consistently surprise you. It’s frequently bonkers, but it works.

Now it’s on Xbox — which includes Xbox One as well as Xbox Series X|S — you can play one of our best games of 2023 [award-winners](https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2023-150053925.html) on virtually everything, so you no longer have any excuses. The PS5 and Switch 2 are also getting a physical release in 2026, which will include the latest DLC.
