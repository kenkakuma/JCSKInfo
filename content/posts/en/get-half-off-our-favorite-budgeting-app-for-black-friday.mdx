The [Quicken Simplifi app](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=538d4172-25c6-4df4-97e9-4ac66dbc1943&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Quicken&linkText=Quicken+Simplifi+app&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWlja2VuLmNvbS9scC9wcGMvYnJhbmQtc2ltcGxpZmkvPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTM4ZDQxNzItMjVjNi00ZGY0LTk3ZTktNGFjNjZkYmMxOTQzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWlja2VuLmNvbS9scC9wcGMvYnJhbmQtc2ltcGxpZmkvPyJ9&signature=AQAAAeBhWeOSInYqTB30Hl7QM-L49QHHgLm_fRgyx35OiO2C&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fbrand-simplifi%2F%3F) is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year. [Quicken Classic](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=538d4172-25c6-4df4-97e9-4ac66dbc1943&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Quicken&linkText=Quicken+Classic&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWlja2VuLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9wcmljaW5nLWNvbXBhcmlzb24tY2xhc3NpYy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzOGQ0MTcyLTI1YzYtNGRmNC05N2U5LTRhYzY2ZGJjMTk0MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucXVpY2tlbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvcHJpY2luZy1jb21wYXJpc29uLWNsYXNzaWMvIn0&signature=AQAAAVCBICUvL1uRETtNwnh4k3cU9Oxpgscxqfn8qrlsUrMj&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quicken.com%2Fproducts%2Fpricing-comparison-classic%2F), the company's "original desktop software" for "experienced investors" is also half off at $6 monthly, down from $12 monthly. The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. 

One of the many things that sets [Quicken Simplifi](https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html) apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. 

It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.
