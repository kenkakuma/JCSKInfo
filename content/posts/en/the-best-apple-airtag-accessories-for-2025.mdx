## Best AirTag holders for 2025

## AirTag holder FAQs

### Why do AirTags need a holder?

AirTags need a holder because they do not have built-in keyring holes like Tile, Chipolo and other Bluetooth trackers do.

### How do you attach an AirTag to things?

You'll need a holder or case to attach an AirTag to your stuff. If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory. But if you want to use one to keep track of your keys, wallet, backpack or even your pet on their collar, you'll need an accessory that can accommodate that use case.

### Do AirTag holders affect tracking performance?

No, AirTag holders should not affect tracking performance.

### Do AirTag holders protect against scratches and impacts?

Yes, AirTag holders can protect against scratches and impacts. Many AirTag cases encircle the edge of the tracker only, leave the two disk sides exposed. For the most protection, look for an AirTag holder than goes around the entire Bluetooth tracker like a sleeve.
