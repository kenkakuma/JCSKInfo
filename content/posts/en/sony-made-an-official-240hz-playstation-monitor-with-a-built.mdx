Sony had some new hardware to reveal during its [State of Play Japan](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-state-of-play-japan-tomorrow-140519040.html) showcase on Tuesday. Along with a refreshed Japanese-only PS5 Digital Edition, the company unveiled an official PlayStation monitor that you can also hook your PC up to. It’s a 27-inch QHD display with a 240Hz refresh rate and support for HDR and [variable refresh rate](https://www.engadget.com/ps5-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-release-date-193228613.html). However, the refresh rate is limited to 120Hz when you’re playing PS5 games.

What’s more, the monitor has a charging hook. It folds down from the rear of the display and you can place your DualSense controller on it, so you’re ready to play whenever the mood strikes. The monitor will be available in the US and Japan sometime next year. Sony hasn’t revealed how much it will cost.

The monitor follows the [Pulse Elevate portable desktop speakers](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-pulse-elevate-portable-speakers-are-coming-for-your-desktop-in-2026-215320963.html) that Sony announced back in September. These will work with PC, Mac, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation Portal and are set to arrive in 2026 as well.

The new hardware seems to be part of the company’s push to become more of a player in PC gaming. For instance, the company recently made it possible to [pair a DualSense controller with more than one device at a time](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-finally-making-it-possible-to-pair-a-dualsense-with-more-than-one-device-211715133.html), making it easier to switch the connection from a PS5 to a PC and vice-versa.
