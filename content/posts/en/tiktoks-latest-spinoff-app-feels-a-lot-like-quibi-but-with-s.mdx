In another attempt to reduce our attention spans to mush, TikTok has released the [PineDrama](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinedrama/id6754134922) app, which offers serialized drama series that are roughly a minute per episode. As first spotted by [_Business Insider_](https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-launches-a-new-micro-drama-app-called-pinedrama-2026-1), the app is designed exactly like [TikTok](https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html), but instead of trendy dance videos, you can scroll through and watch "micro dramas."

For those new to the category, micro dramas are bite-sized TV shows shot in vertical video and available in minute-long episodes. Don't expect any nominations for Best Original Screenplay with series like _The Officer Fell For Me_ or _Married to my past life's nemesis_, since they typically offer soap opera vibes with cliffhangers that keep users scrolling to the next episode. The app is designed to keep people on it with a Discover tab, a place to save favorites and the ability to react in real time alongside other viewers.

Right now, the micro dramas on PineDrama are all free to watch and don't have any ads. It's unclear if TikTok will introduce any costs or ads to the app, since other micro drama options like DramaBox or ReelShort have a paid structure. Late last year, TikTok also introduced a way to watch micro dramas within its own app, with a section called [Minis](https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-jumps-into-micro-dramas-buzzy-bite-sized-soaps-2025-12). It's not the first time we're seeing shorter TV show formats, since Quibi made waves with a format of episodes that were less than 10 minutes long. However, maybe even 10 minutes was too long since the startup eventually [called it quits](https://www.engadget.com/quibi-shut-down-155124687.html) after eight months.
