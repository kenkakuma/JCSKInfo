The Oversight Board is getting ready to tackle a new pain point for Facebook and Instagram users. Up to now, users have been able to appeal content moderation decisions related to specific posts to the board, but haven't been able to ask the group to intervene in other situations that affect their accounts. 

That could soon change. The board says that it will weigh in on individual account-level penalties in a pilot next year. The board noted the change in an [impact report](https://www.oversightboard.com/news/from-bold-experiment-to-essential-institution/) recapping its five-year history and what lies ahead in the year to come. "In 2026, our scope expands once more as we pilot the ability to review Meta’s decisions removing and impacting accounts, something that has created ongoing frustration for platform users," the report says. 

It's not clear how this process will work, but if the board plans to take on account-level issues like suspensions, it would be a significant expansion of its purview. In an interview with Engadget, board member Paolo Carozza said that Meta is expected to refer a case to the board in January that will deal with an account-level issue. The handling of that case will allow the board to explore how it might take on similar cases in the future. 

"We're really excited to take it on because we think it's an important area that really affects a lot of users and their interests," he told Engadget. "We all know how many people are constantly coming forward complaining about account-level restrictions or blocking or whatever else, and so if we get it right — and it's going to be important to work it out this first pilot — we're really optimistic that it's going to help open up a whole new avenue for us to be helpful to the users of \[Meta's\] platforms."

Carozza added that there are a number of "technical aspects" and other questions still being worked out between the board and Meta. So for now, it's too soon to say whether there will ever be an official appeals process for suspensions, like there currently is for post removals. But he says Meta is equally invested in the effort. "It's something we've been talking about with Meta for well over a year," he said. "They've been expressing an openness and a willingness to give us access to those kinds of questions."

The Oversight Board's report hints at another way its influence could potentially expand. It notes that the group's work has made it "well-positioned to partner with a range of global tech companies as they navigate issues arising from free speech debates globally." Both Meta and Oversight Board officials have [previously floated](https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-other-companies-202448589.html) the idea that "other companies" might want to take advantage of its expertise. 

Up to now, most other platforms have had little incentive to do so. But Carozza says the rise of generative AI has created some new interest from non-Meta affiliated platforms, and that there have been "really preliminary" conversations with other companies. "It feels like quite a different moment now, largely because of generative AI, LLMs, chatbots \[and\] the way that a variety of retail-level users of these technologies are facing a whole new set of challenges and harms that's attracting a lot of scrutiny," he said. "We have had conversations in recent months with other tech companies in this space about the possibility that the board might be able to contribute helpful services to them to help navigate some of these really thorny questions."
