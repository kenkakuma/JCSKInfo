Amazon Luna’s December lineup of games has been announced, and there are plenty of early Christmas presents to sink your teeth into. For those unaware, Prime members automatically qualify for [Luna](https://luna.amazon.com/) standard, the entry-level tier of Amazon’s cloud gaming service, and each month the company also hands out a number of codes for PC games that permanently join in your library once redeemed.

Among those claim-and-keep-forever games this month are the underrated open-world Lego racing game, [_Lego 2K Drive_](https://www.engadget.com/lego-2k-drive-lets-you-build-your-dream-race-car-brick-by-brick-113038327.html), the very pretty Metroidvania, _Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus_, and a couple of retro Fallout games, just in time for the [new season](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallouts-new-season-two-trailer-is-filled-with-quick-nods-to-the-source-material-161533128.html) of the Prime Video show. Here’s the full list of games for December. Most come in the form of codes you can redeem on GOG, but a couple are tied to the Epic Games Store or Legacy Gaming.

*   _LEGO 2K Drive_
    
*   _Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus_
    
*   _Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game_
    
*   _Fallout 2_
    
*   _Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection One_
    
*   _Gylt_
    
*   _Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two_
    
*   _Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm_
    
*   _Gunslugs 2_
    
*   _Ashworld_
    
*   _Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Three_
    
*   _Dreamscaper_
    

On the cloud side of things, Luna members can stream the likes of _Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition_, with _Fallout 3_ and fan favorite _New Vegas_ [already](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/prime-gamings-october-2025-lineup-will-get-you-in-the-mood-for-fallout-season-2-170052175.html) available. Quite the month for wasteland wanderers, then. _Mafia: Definitive Edition_, _Hollow Knight_ and _Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition_ also feature in the current library.

Amazon relaunched its [revamped](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazons-revamped-luna-streaming-service-is-available-now-130000613.html) Luna service at the end of October, when it also added a beginner-friendly collection of smartphone-controlled multiplayer games for Prime subscribers to play at no additional cost.
