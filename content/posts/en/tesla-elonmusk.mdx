Tesla CEO Elon Musk shattered his long-held silence on Bitcoin early Tuesday, delivering his strongest cryptocurrency endorsement in years by framing the digital asset as an energy-backed alternative to government-printed fiat currencies amid rising global tensions over artificial intelligence spending.​

"Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy," Musk posted on X in response to a discussion about the global AI arms race and currency debasement. The statement marks his first substantive Bitcoin commentary since Tesla dumped 75% of its holdings in 2022.​

**Market Responds to Musk's Renewed Crypto Interest**

Musk's endorsement came as Bitcoin traded at approximately $111,836, down nearly 3% in 24-hour trading amid broader cryptocurrency market volatility. The broader crypto market fell below $4 trillion on October 14, shedding over $150 billion in value as U.S.-China trade tensions escalated.​

Despite the muted immediate price reaction, the Tesla chief's return to Bitcoin discourse signals renewed interest in cryptocurrency's fundamental value proposition. His comments responding to financial outlet ZeroHedge's analysis linking AI infrastructure spending to rising prices in Bitcoin, gold, and silver.​

Tesla continues to maintain one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries, holding approximately 11,509 BTC worth around $1.29 billion as of current market prices. The company reported a $284 million gain from its Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter of 2025, helping boost its net income amid declining automotive sales.​

**Energy Narrative Resurfaces Amid AI Boom**

Musk's emphasis on Bitcoin's energy foundation reflects growing discourse around power consumption as artificial intelligence development accelerates globally. His statement echoes arguments from Bitcoin advocates like MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor, who has described Bitcoin as "digital energy".​

The timing coincides with heightened concerns about government spending on AI infrastructure, with analysts predicting massive capital expenditures from the U.S. and China to fund technological competition. "AI is the new global arms race, and capex will eventually be funded by governments," ZeroHedge noted in the post that prompted Musk's response.​

This marks a notable shift for Musk, who previously suspended Tesla's Bitcoin payments in 2021 due to environmental concerns about cryptocurrency mining. His latest comments suggest he now views Bitcoin's energy consumption as a feature rather than a flaw, positioning it as "unfakeable" compared to traditional currencies that can be printed at will.​
