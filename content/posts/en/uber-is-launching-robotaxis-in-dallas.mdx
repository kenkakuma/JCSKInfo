Uber has made a big push to offer robotaxis as an option for its rideshare services in more markets this year. Starting today, the company is offering autonomous vehicles as an option for customers in Dallas. The move is in partnership with Avride.

At the start, the AVs providing rides will have a person in the front seat, but Uber plans to have fully driverless operation "in the future." The company will have a small fleet of Avride's Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles to start, but it plans to eventually have hundreds of these AVs working in Dallas. Riders can set their preferences to increase their chances of being paired with a robotaxi in the Uber app. If someone is assigned an AV for their ride, they will have the option to switch to a traditional rideshare driver.

Uber started a partnership with Avride in [October 2024](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-teams-with-avride-to-offer-self-driving-vehicles-for-rides-and-food-deliveries-201622292.html), but the rideshare company has cast a wide net for collaborators. It has also worked to bring robotaxis to markets with Waymo in [Austin](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-ubers-austin-robotaxi-expansion-begins-today-120035908.html) and [Atlanta](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-uber-launch-robotaxi-service-in-atlanta-110056091.html), with Lucid in the [Bay Area](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-and-lucids-robotaxis-will-debut-in-the-bay-area-in-2026-120000876.html), with WeRide in [Abu Dhabi](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-and-werides-abu-dhabi-robotaxi-service-is-now-fully-driverless-133013746.html), and with Momenta in [Europe](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/uber-and-partner-momenta-will-start-testing-robotaxis-in-europe-next-year-123058509.html).
