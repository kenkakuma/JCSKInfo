For years, [we’ve been wondering](https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html) when Samsung would actually bring Ballie, its cute household companion robot, to market and now we finally have our answer: it won’t. After the planned [summer 2025 release window](https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html) came and went, the company has opted not to release the gizmo as a consumer product, at least not for the foreseeable future. 

According to [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-s-rolling-ballie-robot-indefinitely-shelved-after-delays), Samsung has "indefinitely shelved" the robot. A spokesperson told the publication that the company will keep Ballie around as an "active innovation platform" internally. "After multiple years of real-world testing, it continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design," the spokesperson added. 

There’s a sliver of a chance that Samsung will eventually bring Ballie to market, but that seems unlikely as things stand. So, six years after we [first clapped eyes on the robot at CES 2020](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-ballie-ces-2020/), (and two years after [a redesigned larger version](https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-ballie-robot-ball-showed-up-at-ces-2024-with-a-new-look-and-a-built-in-projector-224231693.html) debuted), it appears to be doomed as a consumer device. 

It’s a bit of a shame, as Ballie seemed like a fun gadget. In fairness to Samsung, companies are now likely having to be more judicious about what products — especially more experimental ones — go into full production amid [rising costs of things like RAM](https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-says-ram-costs-will-likely-lead-to-price-hikes-soon-170653524.html).
