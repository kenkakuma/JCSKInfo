There's an official Lego set that [recreates the iconic Enterprise-D](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=46ed863e-0c82-49ee-8105-05dc2d5160d0&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=recreates+the+iconic+Enterprise-D&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0L3N0YXItdHJlay11LXMtcy1lbnRlcnByaXNlLW5jYy0xNzAxLWQtMTAzNTYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ2ZWQ4NjNlLTBjODItNDllZS04MTA1LTA1ZGMyZDUxNjBkMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnby5jb20vZW4tdXMvcHJvZHVjdC9zdGFyLXRyZWstdS1zLXMtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1uY2MtMTcwMS1kLTEwMzU2In0&signature=AQAAAX4P2OnP4VKP6KOlfr7FD1AFLTyWAxLMfaCXZuAar4j-&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fstar-trek-u-s-s-enterprise-ncc-1701-d-10356) from _Star Trek: The Next Generation,_ [after first being teased a few months back](https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-day-announcements-include-a-lego-collaboration-and-a-youtube-kids-series-2000655142)_._ It'll be available on November 28 at a cost of $400. That's Black Friday, for those at home keeping score.

This is a fairly large set, with 3,600 pieces and all kinds of knick-knacks pulled from the show. It ships with nine minifigures, including Captain Picard, Guinan and Worf. Riker even comes with a trombone and Data accompanies his beloved cat, Spot. Every main character is here, even Wesley Crusher. Ensign Ro Laren makes an appearance, for those who want to recreate the crackling tension between her and Picard.

The ship itself is represented in all of its glory. The saucer section is detachable and there's a shuttle bay door that opens. Inside, there are two cute little shuttlepods. All told, the model measures around 10.5 inches tall, 23.5 inches long and 18.5 inches wide. It comes with a stand so it'll look great on that Trek-themed mantle.

The set will be available for preorder soon, but we don't have an actual date on that. It costs $400. Now that we finally have an official Lego Enterprise, where is the Lego Voyager and Lego Deep Space Nine? Get on that.
