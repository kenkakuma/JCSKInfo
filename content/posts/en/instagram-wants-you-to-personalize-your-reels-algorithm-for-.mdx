Last month, Instagram began rolling out a new set of controls that allowed users to [personalize](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-will-let-you-control-which-topics-its-algorithm-recommends-133002612.html) the topics recommended to them by the Reels algorithm. Now, Meta is making that feature [available](https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DTdelJPj3yC) to all English users of the app globally, along with the ability to highlight their top topics for the coming year. 

The feature begins with a selection of topics Meta's AI thinks you're interested in based on your recent activity, and has controls to remove them or add new categories. There's also a separate field for identifying what you want to see less of, and a new "build your 2026 algorithm" that allows you to highlight three topics in particular.

Meta's algorithm tagged a skiing clip as "snowboarding."

I don't yet have the 2026-specific control yet, but I was able to tweak some of my preferred topics and was surprised at how quickly the algorithm seemed to adjust. I added "snowboarding" as a topic and then later, when I clicked over to Reels, the first clip I saw was tagged "snowboarding." Unfortunately, the video wasn't actually about snowboarding — it featured a clip of a freestyle skiing event — so Meta's systems might still need a little work at classifying the actual content. But given how sensitive the Reels algorithm can be, it's nice to have a way of opting out of interests even if you briefly went down a  rabbit hole. 

The feature won't, however, let you ask to see fewer ads. I tried to add "ads" to my "what you want to see less of" list and received an error. "No results found. Try another topic or interest." I was able to successfully add "sponsored content" and "AI" to my "see less" list, though I'm pretty sure the latter will affect videos about AI rather than those made with the help of it.
