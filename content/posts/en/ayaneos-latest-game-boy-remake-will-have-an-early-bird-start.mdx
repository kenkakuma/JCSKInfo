After the high price tag of the [Ayaneo Pocket DMG](https://www.engadget.com/ayaneos-latest-handhelds-are-inspired-by-the-game-boy-and-gb-micro-163412607.html) turned some retro handheld fans away, Ayaneo is working on another remake of the classic Game Boy with a slightly more affordable cost. Ayaneo revealed the pricing for the [Pocket Vert](https://www.ayaneo.com/article/908), which starts at $269 for early bird orders.

Compared to the [Pocket DMG](https://www.ayaneo.com/goods/9003564794101) that retails for $449, Ayaneo skipped the OLED and configurations that go up to 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage for the Pocket Vert. Instead, the handheld maker went with a fully metal CNC body and an ultra-minimalist design with engraving-free buttons that resemble the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011-150056369.html)'s look. Ayaneo built the Pocket Vert with a smaller 3.5-inch LCD screen that has a 1,600 x 1,440 resolution and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip that should allow the handheld to handle anything up to PS2 and some Nintendo Switch games.

To play more modern games, the Pocket Vert has a hidden touch pad below the buttons that acts as a makeshift joystick. Ayaneo also hid a fingerprint sensor in the power button and included a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot for more storage capacity. The [Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/ayaneo/ayaneo-pocket-vertcreate-a-top-of-the-line-gadget-for-vertical-retro-handheld-gamers) for the Pocket Vert isn't open yet, but it will be the only place to snag the latest vertical handheld from Ayaneo at its lowest price before it reverts to the retail price of $339. You can even opt for the fully specced-out version that's only available in Lava Red and has 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage for an early bird price of $369 and a later standard price of $439.
