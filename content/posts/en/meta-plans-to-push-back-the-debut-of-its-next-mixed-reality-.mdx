The big reveal for Meta's next mixed reality glasses is being postponed until the first half of 2027, according to a report from [_Business Insider_](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-delays-new-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-phoenix-2025-12). Based on an internal memo from Maher Saba, the vice president of Meta's Reality Labs Foundation, the report said that the company's project, which is codenamed "Phoenix," will no longer be scheduled for a 2026 debut.

In a separate memo, Meta execs explained that the delay would help deliver a more "polished and reliable experience." According to _BI_, a memo from Meta's Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns said this new release window is "going to give us a lot more breathing room to get this right." Meta hasn't publicly revealed many details about its Phoenix project, but [_The Information_](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bytedance-developing-mixed-reality-goggles-challenge-meta) previously reported that it would feature a goggle-like form factor with an external power source, similar to how the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apple-vision-pro-m5-review-a-better-beta-is-still-a-beta-130000284.html) is attached to a battery pack.

In the memo from Saba, _BI_ reported that Meta is also working on a "limited edition" wearable with the codename "Malibu 2." Yesterday, Meta announced its acquisition of [Limitless](https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-latest-acquisition-suggests-hardware-plans-beyond-glasses-and-headsets-212930339.html), a startup that recently developed an AI wearable called Pendant. Even though Meta's current product portfolio is dominated by smart glasses and [VR headsets](https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html), the Limitless acquisition and Malibu 2 project could hint at the company's plans to expand its offerings.
