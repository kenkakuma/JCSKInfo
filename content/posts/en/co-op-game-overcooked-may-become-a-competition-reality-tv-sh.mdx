Hilarious co-op video game _Overcooked_ is making the move to the real world. A24 has acquired the rights to the popular indie hit and [_Deadline_](https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/) reports that the company is working with Netflix to develop the concept into an unscripted competition reality TV series. I adore this idea, and with the right people behind it, I think it could be a masterwork of reality TV. According to the reports, this is the first time independent film and TV studio A24 will make a reality show, but Netflix has already had some success with food and cooking programs, such as with the absolute gem that is _Nailed It!_ 

The often ridiculous antics of _Overcooked_ are a wonderful match for that type of lighthearted competition show. In the game, one to four players work together to cook customers' food orders as quickly as possible while the environment creates silly, unexpected obstacles. Unfortunately, there's no way the Netflix legal team will green light challenges where contestants might fall into actual lava, and recreating the space travel levels would probably blow the budget. But I can see all sorts of _Overcooked_\-style mayhem from sliding on icy floors or suddenly moving countertops. I’m also imagining a lot of dashing between inconveniently placed kitchen appliances and occasionally plunging the contestants into total darkness. There’s no timeline given in _Deadline_’s report, but I cannot wait for this to exist.
