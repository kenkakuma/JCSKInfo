Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment, the developer of The Division series, [_Star Wars Outlaws_](https://www.engadget.com/i-really-want-to-like-star-wars-outlaws-160032476.html) and [_Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora_](https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandoras-adventurous-spirit-might-just-win-you-over-160024430.html) is offering some employees volunteer buyouts as it attempts to "realign" its teams, the company said in a [post on X](https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732). The move is designed to "strengthen our roadmap," Massive wrote, as it focuses on The Division series along with its Snowdrop engine and Ubisoft Connect. Ubisoft notably didn't mention Star Wars and Avatar in that statement, an omission that may effectively spell the demise of those franchises. 

Massive framed the layoffs as a "voluntary career transition program... supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance." Workers at the Massive studio in Malm, Sweden can volunteer until December 13 for the package, which primarily targets people between projects waiting for new assignments, according to the French news site [_Le Figaro_](https://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/les-reductions-d-effectifs-chez-ubisoft-touchent-le-studio-derriere-le-jeu-video-star-wars-outlaws-20251022). 

Another Ubisoft studio, Helsinki-based RedLynx, also [announced](https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/) that it was restructuring "as part of Ubisoft's global efforts to simplify, reduce costs and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency." If implemented, the proposal would result in a maximum of 60 workers being let go, RedLynx said. 

Following the underperformance of key titles like _Star Wars Outlaws_ and _Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora_, Ubisoft has shuttered offices and laid off workers at offices in San Francisco, London and [Leamington](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html). Last year, the company's headcount [dropped](https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff) from 20,279 to 18,666 at the end of September. Earlier this month, Ubisoft partnered with Tencent to launch [Vantage Studios](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html), which now houses the company's tentpole franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.
