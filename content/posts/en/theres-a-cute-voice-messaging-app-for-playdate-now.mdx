If your friend group or family happens to include multiple Playdate owners, there's now a cute way to chat amongst yourselves right within the device. Jon Simantov, the developer who gave us _Cranky Cove,_ has released an app called [helloyellow](https://helloyellow.app/) where you can send voice messages, create group chats and share achievements with anyone you've added as a friend. It's available to download from [itch.io](https://jonsimantov.itch.io/helloyellow) for free, with some limitations, or $5 to get the full version. Now, excuse me while I lament being the only person in my circle with a passion for weird little gadgets.

The app works over Wi-Fi, but you can record messages even when you're offline that will be sent once you reconnect. You can also record voice notes for yourself. The full version of helloyellow allows for messages of up to 10 minutes long, while messages in the free version are capped at two minutes. Friends are added via hellocodes, and there's an emoji library so you can send reactions.
