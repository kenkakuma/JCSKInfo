Netflix is continuing to double down on podcasts, with the streaming service's announcement that it has hired talent to host two original shows for its platform. The first show stars NFL Hall of Famer-turned-analyst Michael Irvin and the second is a talk show for former Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson.

_The White House with Michael Irvin_ [premieres](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2a170a1e-7e5c-4edd-b5dd-ea6d3bd9416a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=1de232ac-0f3a-4086-a8c5-877068853ddd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Netflix&linkText=premieres&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXRmbGl4LmNvbS90dWR1bS9hcnRpY2xlcy93aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS13aXRoLW1pY2hhZWwtaXJ2aW4tcG9kY2FzdCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWRlMjMyYWMtMGYzYS00MDg2LWE4YzUtODc3MDY4ODUzZGRkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXRmbGl4LmNvbS90dWR1bS9hcnRpY2xlcy93aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS13aXRoLW1pY2hhZWwtaXJ2aW4tcG9kY2FzdCJ9&signature=AQAAAYT2Z15131yJFkQvfHPaVKAylGlcZf4r7VeYVCBnGl-C&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftudum%2Farticles%2Fwhite-house-with-michael-irvin-podcast) January 19. The abode in the title refers to a building near the Dallas Cowboys facilities rather than the seat of US presidential power, but the overlap was intentional. "In a crowded media landscape, recognition matters — and few names carry the same immediate weight," Irvin said. The podcast will have new episodes twice weekly with a rotating panel of co-hosts and guests covering sports news, commentary and analysis.

Episodes will primarily be filmed in Davidson's garage. The Netflix exclusive premieres its first episode on January 30 at 12:01AM PT.
