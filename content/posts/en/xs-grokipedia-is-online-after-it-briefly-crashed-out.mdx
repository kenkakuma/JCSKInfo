Grokipedia, the encyclopedia powered by xAI's assistant Grok briefly went online Monday, before it promptly crashed. At the time of this writing, the website appears to be working, and contains more than 885,000 articles, according to a counter on [its homepage](https://grokipedia.com/).   

Musk, who has previously [railed against](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/elon-musk-also-has-a-problem-with-wikipedia) Wikipedia, has described the project as a "a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the Universe." Musk and his allies have long claimed that Wikipedia is biased. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales [has called](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/wikipedia-founder-responds-to-elon-musk-wokepedia) Musk's claims about the crowd-sourced encyclopedia "factually incorrect."

Musk said [last week](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980340232194257090) that Grokipedia's launch had been delayed in order "to do more work to purge out the propaganda." Notably, some articles are nearly identical to their entries in Wikipedia, though Grokipedia doesn’t contain in-line links to sources in the same format. Such entries do have a small disclaimer that “the content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License.”

In other cases, social media users have already spotted instances where Musk’s worldview is more obvious in the "AI-powered encyclopedia." Here's an excerpt from the entry for "university," as captured by Bluesky user [Jeremy Cohen](https://bsky.app/profile/jeremyfcohen.bsky.social/post/3m47dlennhs26).
