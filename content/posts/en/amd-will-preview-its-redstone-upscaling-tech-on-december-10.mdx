The AI upscaling upgrade for AMD graphics cards is nearly here. On Tuesday, AMD said it will reveal FSR "Redstone," its answer to [NVIDIA's DLSS](https://www.engadget.com/computing/nvidia-announced-dlss-4-will-come-to-all-rtx-gpus-044835926.html), on December 10.

Upscaling tech has been a big sticking point in [comparisons between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-buy-a-gpu-160100017.html). Despite big improvements in FSR 5, NVIDIA's DLSS still outperforms AMD's tech in most metrics. AMD hopes Redstone will close the gap.

The company hasn't yet gone into great detail about the tech. But we know Redstone offers more than just better ML-powered upscaling. It also has improved AI frame generation, ray regeneration and radiance caching. (_PC Gamer_ [notes](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-finally-gives-its-ai-enhanced-fsr-redstone-upscaling-tech-a-december-10-launch-date/) that [_Call of Duty: Black Ops 7_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-appears-to-feature-ai-generated-art-assets-201746595.html) already has Redstone’s ray regeneration portion built in.)

Naturally, AMD is marketing it as a selling point of its [RDNA 4-series GPUs](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-previews-rdna-4-graphics-with-ai-upscaling-teases-rx-9070-gpus-194500173.html). The company's latest cards, like the Radeon RX 9070 series, are already [the strongest the company has made in years](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-hitting-nvidia-where-it-hurts-140014376.html). If AMD can master this tech, then its budget cards, like [the already potent 9060 XT](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review-finally-a-powerful-350-gpu-130037952.html), could grow much more appealing.
