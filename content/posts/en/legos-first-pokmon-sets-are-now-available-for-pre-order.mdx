We learned [last March](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-pokemon-are-coming-in-2026-154206963.html) that Lego and Pokémon would be joining forces and the first results of their partnership are here. Pre-orders for all three kits are open now, with an expected ship date of February 27. As one might have guessed from the lightning bolts on the previous promotional image, one of the debut pocket monsters getting the brick treatment is [Pikachu](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=4d92e386-e894-457c-8939-f0e4c78dcfdd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=Pikachu&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0L3Bpa2FjaHUtYW5kLXBva2UtYmFsbC03MjE1MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGQ5MmUzODYtZTg5NC00NTdjLTg5MzktZjBlNGM3OGRjZmRkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0L3Bpa2FjaHUtYW5kLXBva2UtYmFsbC03MjE1MiJ9&signature=AQAAAY1AR0Lufv1POkSP3Z1iSIm889PkgLLiKrTaaCLiYjMg&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152), complete with a Poké Ball. The 2,050-piece kit can be built to show Pikachu either leaping out of the open Poké Ball into battle or at rest staring up at the builder, closed Poké Ball between his paws. The Pikachu kit costs $200.

There's also a 587-piece model of [Eevee](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=4d92e386-e894-457c-8939-f0e4c78dcfdd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=Eevee&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0L2VldmVlLTcyMTUxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZDkyZTM4Ni1lODk0LTQ1N2MtODkzOS1mMGU0Yzc4ZGNmZGQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3Byb2R1Y3QvZWV2ZWUtNzIxNTEifQ&signature=AQAAAeXAEtWwGiI7EuPkdq0t7fSxDewWSLZPOVjSCsv0eCDB&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151), which goes for $60. On the bigger side is a set featuring a trio of Pokémon: [Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=4d92e386-e894-457c-8939-f0e4c78dcfdd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=Venusaur%2C+Charizard+and+Blastoise&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9wcm9kdWN0L3ZlbnVzYXVyLWNoYXJpemFyZC1hbmQtYmxhc3RvaXNlLTcyMTUzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0ZDkyZTM4Ni1lODk0LTQ1N2MtODkzOS1mMGU0Yzc4ZGNmZGQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3Byb2R1Y3QvdmVudXNhdXItY2hhcml6YXJkLWFuZC1ibGFzdG9pc2UtNzIxNTMifQ&signature=AQAAAVOMO0A_lcJwxUFeW10_d5Z8vfak85RjLz4Onqh8Jp5Q&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153). This kit has 6,838 pieces and can show the group together in battle formation or separately in their own mini environments. It retails for $650.

Lego

Before you leap to pre-order pages, however, here's a word of caution. In Lego form, our little friends look…kinda strange? I'm not the biggest Lego builder, but I am a rather accomplished architect in _Minecraft_, so I am well aware of the innate challenge in constructing a rounded shape from square blocks. Take Pikachu, for instance. Part of his appeal is his chubby little cheeks. There are bricks with more rounded sides in this collection that hint at his usual rotundness, but the proportions of his face just feel a little off to me. I had the same reaction to the other figures as well, although Eevee seems to have fared a little better than the others. They're all sort of cute, but not nearly so cute as they are in other formats. But like I said, Lego is not my personal block of choice, so perhaps I'm in the minority here! If you love these bricky pocket monsters, then roll on over to Lego's website and snap up these kits faster than a Mewtwo.
