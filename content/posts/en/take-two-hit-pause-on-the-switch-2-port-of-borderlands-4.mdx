2K owner Take-Two has paused development on _Borderlands 4_ for the Nintendo Switch 2, the company shared during its [Q3 2026 earnings presentation](https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings). The Switch 2 port was [originally planned to be released](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-owners-can-play-borderlands-4-on-october-3-200651283.html) on October 3, 2025, a few weeks after the game's September 12 launch on all other platforms, but was [indefinitely delayed](https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?s=20) on September 23.

"We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU," [Take-Two told _Variety_](https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/). "Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have _PGA Tour 2K25_ coming out and _WWE 2K26_, and we're incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future."

When the _Borderlands 4_ Switch 2 port was originally delayed, the game's developer Gearbox shared that the port needed "additional development and polish time" and that it hoped to "better align this release with the addition of cross saves." In Take-Two's [Q2 earnings presentation](https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40) on November 6, 2025, the Switch 2 port was still listed as having a "TBA" release date. The lack of mention in the company's Q3 presentation and Take-Two's comment to _Variety_ pretty much confirm that if a Switch 2 version happens, it won't be anytime soon. The official [_Borderlands 4_ post-release content roadmap](https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/) currently lists plans for paid and free story DLC and raid bosses, but nothing related to additional ports of the game.

_Grand Theft Auto VI_'s planned [November 19 release date](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html) is still on the books, however. Rockstar Games' next blockbuster title was originally [supposed to be released in fall 2025](https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html), before it was delayed to [May 2026](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html) last May. The game was delayed a second and final time — at least for now — in November 2025, to its current November 2026 release date.

There's still room for another delay, but in the earnings statement Take-Two projected confidence, sharing that Rockstar would start marketing the game this summer. The franchise remains a cash cow, so it’s only natural the company would want to get the rollout of _Grand Theft Auto VI_ right. As part of its earnings presentation, Take-Two shared that _Grand Theft Auto V_, which was originally released all the way back in 2013, has sold 225 million units.
