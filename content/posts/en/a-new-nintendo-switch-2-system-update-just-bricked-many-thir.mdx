The most recent Switch 2 software update looks to have bricked many third-party docks and related accessories, according to users [across the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/) and a [report by _Kotaku_](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081). We don't know if this was an intentional move by Nintendo or simply an accident. Engadget has reached out to the company for clarification.

The Switch 2 update 21.0.0 brings some much-needed quality-of-life features, like the ability to turn off autoplaying videos in the eShop and new icons that indicate whether a game is digital or physical. However, it also brought along the aforementioned dock hiccup.

Switch 2 owners have reported that these docks either don't work at all or are now much more finicky, often requiring a restart. This doesn't seem to have impacted all third-party docks, but complaints are coming in pertaining to many different products. YouTuber AustinJohnPlays tested out two different Switch 2 dock dongles after the update and reported that both were borked.

Nintendo has responded to these allegations, suggesting that this was an accident that only impacted certain devices. The company wrote that it "does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility." Sometimes new console firmware impacts third-party accessories. At the very least, this was [something that happened to the original Switch](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/266542-third-party-docks-bricking-switches-nintendo-firmware-update) a couple of times. 

The companies that make these accessories will have to perform their own software updates to get things going again. In the meantime, exercise caution when buying a third-party dock. 

**Update, November 14 2025, 12:55PM ET:** This story has been updated to include Nintendo's response and a likely cause of the issue.
