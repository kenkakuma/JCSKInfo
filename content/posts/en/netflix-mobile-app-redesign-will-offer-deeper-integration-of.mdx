After testing the feature for the last six months or so, Netflix said it will bring vertical videos to its mobile app sometime later in 2026, TechCrunch reported. So far, the feature has been used to show clips promoting Netflix films and TV shows, letting you swipe to move to the next one _à la_ TikTok or YouTube Shorts.

Going forward, though, it could also serve as a promotion tool for new types of programs. “You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,” co-CEO Greg Peters said in an [earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/live/GYqP8zJLYKk).

That was another subject of discussion, as Netflix is taking on YouTube with new video podcasts. The company debuted the first of those originals [last week](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-will-air-new-video-podcasts-from-pete-davidson-and-michael-irvin-this-month-224353011.html), including shows from sports commentator Michael Irvin and comedian Peter Davidson. It’s also offering hosting content like the Bill Simmons Podcast and other shows from The Ringer.

Despite increasing competition from YouTube and other social media networks, Netflix is doing all right. In 2025, the company saw $45.2 billion revenue including $1.5 billion in ad dollars from its lower tier subscriptions. The streamer counted 325 million paid subscribers around the world at the end of last year.
