Through December 4, you’ll be able to get 50 percent off the regular annual subscription price, bringing a full year of guided meditations, sleep sounds and mindfulness tools down to $35 per year. If you’ve been looking to build a better daily routine, this discount makes it easier to start.

Headspace has become one of the most recognizable names in digital mindfulness. The app blends practical meditation guidance with structured courses and calming soundscapes designed to make everyday stress easier to manage. Its programs cover everything from beginner-friendly introductions to mindfulness to focused content on topics like anxiety, productivity and sleep.

Subscribers get access to hundreds of guided sessions led by the Headspace team, including short daily practices that can be completed in a few spare minutes, plus longer courses that help build consistency. The app’s Sleepcasts and soundscapes are unique, designed to create a steady nighttime routine that promotes better rest. For mornings, there are breathing exercises and motivational mini-sessions that can help set focus for the day ahead.

Headspace also includes personalized progress tracking, mood check-ins and optional reminders that make it easier to stay consistent with your new mindfulness habits. For anyone new to meditation, the app’s clear structure is a major strength. You don’t have to know where to start, since it suggests sessions based on your goals or current mood.

This annual deal is ideal for users who want to stick with mindfulness practice over time, or anyone interested in incorporating a new habit into their lives. Paying for the year upfront typically saves money compared with the monthly plan, and the discount brings that cost down even further. Whether you’re learning the basics of meditation or refining an existing routine, the full library provides enough variety to keep things engaging throughout the year.
