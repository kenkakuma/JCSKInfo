Philips Hue has introduced a new software feature called [SpatialAware](https://hueblog.com/2026/01/07/spatialaware-philips-hue-announces-new-lighting-feature/) at CES 2026 designed to ensure that all the lights in a space are in harmony with each other. Available exclusively for the Hue Bridge Pro, it takes into account each light point in a room and tailors the colors to ensure a natural representation. "In a sunset scene, for example, the lights on one side of the room emit warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side reflect darker shades," the company wrote on its blog. The new feature is set to launch in the spring of 2026.

To use the feature, you scan a room with your smartphone camera and use augmented reality to determine the positions of individual lights. A smart algorithm then ensures each light point is coordinated. Any lamps added after setup will be taken into account. Then, you use SpatialAware to select a scene like "Lake Mist" and activate the mode.

In the example at top, the company shows how all the lights in a room are "no linger mixed together in a colorful jumble \[above\] but are perfectly coordinated. The same applies, for example, to the gradient color transitions of corresponding products, where SpatialAware even takes the orientation into account."

Philips Hue also introduced a few other features. To start with, the company is adding support for migrating multiple Hue Bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the setup process. In addition, the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors will soon work with Apple Home. Users will also see live video with picture-in-picture mode on Apple TV and get real-time alerts on the Apple Home app. 

The Hue AI assistant has been updated so you can now creation automations based on natural language requests — for instance, "wake me up at 6:45 AM every day except on Wednesdays." New AI assistant languages have been added (Dutch, German and Spanish) and the Hue app will start showing automations within the rooms and zones they're set to control, so you won't need to jump around in the app as much. All those new features are set to arrive in Q1 2026.
