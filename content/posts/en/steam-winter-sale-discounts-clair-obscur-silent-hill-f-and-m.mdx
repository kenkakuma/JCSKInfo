Holiday shopping is in full swing, which means it's about time for the [Steam Winter Sale](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/492711197218440447?l=english). This go-around, Valve’s sale runs from December 18, 2025 through January 5, 2026, and includes discounts on some of this year's hit games, like [_Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-an-original-hit-rpg-090012488.html), [_Silent Hill f_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-preview-gamescom-2025-123030305.html) and [_Assassin's Creed Shadows_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-review-an-ambitious-and-captivating-world-thats-stuck-in-the-past-170008367.html).

[_Clair Obscur_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/) is available for $40, down from its normal $50, [_Silent Hill f_](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1049570) is 40 percent off, bringing its price down to $42, and the normally $70 [_Assassin's Creed Shadows_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/) is selling for $35, a solid deal on what was somewhat of a comeback for the long-running Ubisoft series. On top of those sales, you can get [_Stardew Valley_](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/82712) for $9, or the difficult-to-master walking sim [_Baby Steps_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281040/Baby_Steps/) for $13. I'm also considering picking up [_Consume Me_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/) for $10 and [_Ball x Pit_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/) for $12, just to round out my collection of indie hits from 2025.

Valve runs Steam sales on a pretty regular cadence, so if the game you're eyeing isn't on sale, there's a good chance it could be soon. With holiday vacations coming up, and hopefully time to play games on the menu, though, now's the perfect time to pick up something new. And if you don't get to it this year, consider it an investment of sorts for the [Steam Machine](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html) you might purchase in 2026.
