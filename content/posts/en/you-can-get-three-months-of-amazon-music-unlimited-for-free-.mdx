Amazon’s [Black Friday](https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/) and [Cyber Monday](https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/) sales might be over, but the company is still running a [deal](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=8c6180f1-bd75-4f54-8f50-74da3082b763&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=deal&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL211c2ljL3VubGltaXRlZC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGM2MTgwZjEtYmQ3NS00ZjU0LThmNTAtNzRkYTMwODJiNzYzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL211c2ljL3VubGltaXRlZC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAASspqZIMAiwfY06_cmFbv0hLkTGPaaXInb7Kf_CXVv2u&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fmusic%2Funlimited%2F) on its premium music streaming service. Right now, you can get three months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free if you’re a new subscriber.

As with most offers of this nature, your subscription will auto-renew for the full price of $12 per month (or $11 for Prime members) after your three months are up. But you can cancel whenever you like and won’t be charged a penny if you do so before the trial ends.

Amazon Music Unlimited offers lossless streaming and podcasts, and as you’d expect, it works best with Amazon’s ever-swelling army of [Alexa](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html) devices. It’s a bit clunky compared to the likes of Apple Music and Spotify, and not as good for music discovery and curation, but the app has made strides over the years. It even has [its own](https://www.engadget.com/apps/amazon-musics-year-end-recap-arrives-today-130029446.html) Spotify Wrapped-alike now.

If you do take advantage of this deal, bear in mind that Amazon Music Unlimited is more expensive than Apple Music, YouTube Music and Tidal without a Prime subscription, after Amazon put its [prices](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/amazon-music-unlimited-subscription-prices-are-rising-again-232426667.html) up earlier this year. A paid Spotify Premium Individual plan costs the same as Amazon’s service (sans Prime), and you can also try that for [free](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=449e2503-c6b5-44c5-bdb8-b3045047b3e5&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=8c6180f1-bd75-4f54-8f50-74da3082b763&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Spotify&linkText=free&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG90aWZ5LmNvbS91cy9wcmVtaXVtLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGM2MTgwZjEtYmQ3NS00ZjU0LThmNTAtNzRkYTMwODJiNzYzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG90aWZ5LmNvbS91cy9wcmVtaXVtLyJ9&signature=AQAAAWads0Up6SajEgrkE8V2_TKCdgcGQrD64ek6NiAwnh7q&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spotify.com%2Fus%2Fpremium%2F) right now, with the company offering four months without payment provided you’ve never been a Premium subscriber in the past.
