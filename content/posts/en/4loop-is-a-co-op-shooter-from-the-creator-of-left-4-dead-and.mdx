The next game from _Left 4 Dead_ designer Mike Booth is putting a sci-fi spin on his last game's co-op action, [based on a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-5ieEtmgTc) Booth and producer JJ Abrams shared at The Game Awards 2025. The new game is called _4:LOOP_, and it's the first project entirely developed by [Bad Robot Games](https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-08-j-j-abrams-bad-robot-gaming-tencent.html), film production company Bad Robot's game studio.

_4:LOOP_ combines the four-player co-op action of _Left 4 Dead_, with roguelike elements enabled by what seems like a time loop mechanic. Based on the trailer, players fight a mixture of aliens and robots in each mission, all in the hopes of eventually drawing the attention of an alien mothership and destroying it.

"Each time the four-player team succeeds in a mission, they make choices to improve their equipment, building out a unique kit to survive the epic boss battle at the end of the Act," Booth said [in an interview with PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/). "If the team completes all three Acts, they defeat the Mothership and save the world. All of this is, of course, easier said than done."

Sony Interactive Entertainment [announced](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-teams-up-with-bad-robot-and-the-creator-of-left-4-dead-for-a-co-op-shooter-144637802.html) that it would be publishing _4:LOOP_ earlier in December, so naturally the game will be available on PS5 and PC when it launches. Players interested in trying _4:LOOP_ can sign up on [the game's website](https://www.badrobotgames.com/4loop).
