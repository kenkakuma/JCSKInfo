Another first-party Xbox game is making the leap to PlayStation 5. This time around, Obsidian’s _Avowed_ — one of our [favorite games of last year](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html) — is crossing the great divide. The fantasy action RPG will hit Sony’s console [on February 17](https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-is-coming-to-playstation-5), one day shy of the game’s first anniversary. 

As it happens, an [anniversary update](https://www.obsidian.net/news/avowed-updated-roadmap) is set to go live on all platforms at the same time. This includes a new game+ mode (allowing those who have beaten the RPG to replay it with all their gear and upgrades from their previous run), a photo mode, a new weapon type and more. 

_Avowed_ is set in the same universe as Obsidian’s Pillars of Eternity games. It tasks you with investigating a fungal plague that has infested the world. “The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant," Engadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt wrote. "_Avowed_ is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking."

Microsoft has brought a string of first-party Xbox games to PS5 over the last couple of years, freeing them from console exclusivity. _Forza Horizon 5, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II_ and _Sea of Thieves_ are among the games that have crossed over to PlayStation. Later this year, you’ll even be able to [play a Halo game on PS5](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-remake-of-the-original-story-coming-to-xbox-pc-and-ps5-in-2026-203913552.html), something that was utterly unthinkable not too long ago.
