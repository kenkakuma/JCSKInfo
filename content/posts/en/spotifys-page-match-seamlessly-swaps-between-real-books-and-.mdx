I have a love-hate relationship with Spotify that might just be leaning more towards love today. While I [struggle](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-no-longer-running-ads-for-ice-130000672.html) with [some of the](https://www.avclub.com/spotify-stands-by-ice-recruitment-ads) company's choices about the [type of content it allows on its platform](https://www.engadget.com/spotify-transparency-problem-joe-rogan-160014022.html), I have always had a soft spot for its [Wrapped](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html) roundups and the monthly [audiobook hours included with](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotifys-premium-audiobook-feature-launches-in-the-us-140010986.html) [my Premium subscription](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotifys-premium-audiobook-feature-launches-in-the-us-140010986.html). For those like me, Spotify’s news today will likely enhance the appeal of its audiobook offerings. It’s announcing a partnership with [](http://Bookshop.org)Bookshop.org — which lets indie bookstores sell their wares online through a unified platform — allowing users to buy physical books from within its app, and launching a new Page Match feature that helps sync your progress across the physical books you read and the audiobooks in Spotify’s catalog. Also, the audiobook recap feature that summarizes the plot so far is expanding to Android this spring, [following its iOS debut](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotify-is-adding-recaps-for-audiobooks-133000324.html) (in beta form) last fall.

Page Match is coming to all places where Spotify’s audiobooks are available, starting with the English language titles in its 500,000-strong library. Meanwhile, you can access Bookshop within the Spotify app in the US and the UK, where Bookshop operates. 

Though I’m thrilled that this will mean easier and greater support of independent bookstores in those areas, I’m more excited by the prospect of Page Match, which I previewed at a recent launch event in the company’s offices in New York. I’m the sort of person who reads the same title in its ebook, physical and audio forms. (I often wish that a purchase of a physical book came with free ebook and audio versions, but that’s besides the point.) 

While Kindles currently do a decent job of getting you to your latest page read across various devices, switching between, say, Martha Wells’ _All Systems Red_ on Spotify and the paperback copy is not quite as easy. With Page Match, though, that should get a lot easier.

## How does Spotify Page Match work?

When you get access to the feature (which is rolling out today), you’ll find the Page Match button under the title of each audiobook. You’ll have to first look up the book on Spotify and tap into its full chapter list to find this, which means the book you want to use has to be one of the hundreds of thousands in the company’s library. Then, tap the green “Scan to listen” button if you’re looking to move over to the audio version or “Scan to read” below it if you’re switching over to a hard copy instead.

Whichever you pick, you’ll need to enable access to your device’s camera and then scan the page of the book you’re on. This should work on ereaders as well, and appears to be using some form of optical character recognition to match the part of the book to its audio counterpart.

If you’re scanning to listen, the process is fairly straightforward. Once you’ve placed the page in the viewfinder, the app will quickly jump to that very spot in the chapter track. I’ll note that it was hard for me to confirm whether this actually worked during my first demo, since I never felt like I found the words being spoken on the page I was looking at. In this case, it was _Lights Out: An Into Darkness novel_ by Navessa Allen, and I mostly felt like the narration had simply gone past the page I was on, rather than a complete failure. Subsequent attempts with other books, like Stephen King’s _It,_ were more effective.

Things get a bit trickier when you’re trying to move from audio book to the paper (or ereader). After pressing “Scan to read,” you’ll need to place a page in front of the camera and wait for it to tell you to move forward or backward. Ideally, you’d already know more or less where you were, so you won’t have to flip too many pages.

In my demo, because we were a few chapters too far from where we paused in the early part of _It_, there was a lot more page-turning required to get to the right spot. What I found helpful was the progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which highlighted the correct location and how far away we were from it. The instructions “Move forward” and “Move back” were clear and came up in a timely manner. When we finally landed on the right page, the screen highlighted the specific lines on the page to start from, too.

I have to caveat this with the observation that there were a few starts and stops during my demo, which were resolved once I established a solid internet connection. And though “Scan to read” did eventually work as promised, there was a bit of flipping around that seemed to be part of the process, which might be tedious and not quite the magical experience some might expect.

The good news is that Spotify seems to already be working on even more features to make it easier to read physical books in tandem with listening to audiobooks. The company said it sees “the future of reading as one that’s personalized, flexible, and built to move fluidly across formats and moments. Page Match is an early example of how Spotify is helping shape that future at scale. “
