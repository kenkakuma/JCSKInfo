The State of New York will [now require](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-require-warning-labels-social-media-platforms) social media platforms to display warning labels similar to those found on cigarettes. [The bill](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/S4505) was passed by the [New York Legislature in June](https://www.wxxinews.org/local-news/2025-06-19/new-york-state-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-add-mental-health-warning-label-for-social-media) and signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday. It will apply to any platforms that feature infinite scrolling, auto-play, like counts or algorithmic feeds. The labels will caution those on the platform about potential harm to young users' mental health.

Social media companies will be required to display these warning labels when a user first interacts with any of the features the state considers predatory. The warning will also be displayed periodically after that interaction. 

"Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use," Gov. Hochul [said in a statement](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-require-warning-labels-social-media-platforms). The law will apply when any of these platforms are being accessed from New York. Gov. Hochul also [signed two bills](https://www.engadget.com/new-york-governor-signs-two-new-bills-into-law-protecting-kids-from-social-media-211935749.html) into law last year aimed at protecting kids from social media.

Concerns over the mental health effects of social media platforms on younger users have been mounting and government bodies have been increasingly taking action. A bill similar to the one in New York has been [proposed in California](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-new-california-bill-would-add-warning-labels-to-social-media-platforms-233653838.html). This year [Australia](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/australia-is-adding-twitch-to-its-social-media-ban-for-children-202033276.html) became the first nation to ban social media for children, with [Denmark](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/denmark-set-to-ban-social-media-for-users-under-15-years-of-age-171602408.html) soon to follow.

Last year the US surgeon general [said social media](https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-says-that-social-media-like-cigarettes-should-come-with-warning-labels-171005572.html) should come with warning labels and highlighted [data](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749480) associating social media use with increased anxiety and depression in youth. The risks of social media use on children's mental health are [multifactorial](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e1fe4ee4-58fb-4e08-bb86-6b27247202b1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=800eb432-6e82-4126-a6ad-b50b196bae7b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Mayo+Clinic&linkText=multifactorial&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXlvY2xpbmljLm9yZy9oZWFsdGh5LWxpZmVzdHlsZS90d2Vlbi1hbmQtdGVlbi1oZWFsdGgvaW4tZGVwdGgvdGVlbnMtYW5kLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS11c2UvYXJ0LTIwNDc0NDM3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MDBlYjQzMi02ZTgyLTQxMjYtYTZhZC1iNTBiMTk2YmFlN2IiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1heW9jbGluaWMub3JnL2hlYWx0aHktbGlmZXN0eWxlL3R3ZWVuLWFuZC10ZWVuLWhlYWx0aC9pbi1kZXB0aC90ZWVucy1hbmQtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXVzZS9hcnQtMjA0NzQ0MzcifQ&signature=AQAAAWuSX3EsyWG05DetiL7aq1mNjBMwGiwvKfgJZmf7oOTh&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fhealthy-lifestyle%2Ftween-and-teen-health%2Fin-depth%2Fteens-and-social-media-use%2Fart-20474437) and are still [being studied](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/22/teens-social-media-and-mental-health/).
