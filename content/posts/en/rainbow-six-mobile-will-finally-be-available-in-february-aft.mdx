The long-awaited _Rainbow Six Mobile_ [comes out on February 23](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=28025780-b8d4-4d69-a871-3ccc8bc61d81&featureId=text-link&linkText=comes+out+on+February+23&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MudWJpc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yYnhRMWVHTHhTUkdnNFhnaHBIRm84L3JhaW5ib3ctc2l4LW1vYmlsZS1sYXVuY2hpbmctd29ybGR3aWRlLW9uLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTIzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyODAyNTc4MC1iOGQ0LTRkNjktYTg3MS0zY2NjOGJjNjFkODEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51Ymlzb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlLzJieFExZUdMeFNSR2c0WGdocEhGbzgvcmFpbmJvdy1zaXgtbW9iaWxlLWxhdW5jaGluZy13b3JsZHdpZGUtb24tZmVicnVhcnktMjMifQ&signature=AQAAAergmlOizHF_DdFgm6xvaw7hlvqwM1FBdR_1jm1GciCf&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2F2bxQ1eGLxSRGg4XghpHFo8%2Frainbow-six-mobile-launching-worldwide-on-february-23) for iOS and Android devices. This is a global release and [follows years of testing](https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-rainbow-six-mobile-announcement-130047665.html) and [some significant delays](https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-its-rainbow-six-and-division-mobile-games-until-at-least-april-2025-174035060.html).

This is basically a smartphone version of the [popular tactical shooter](https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-11-rainbow-six-siege-35-million-players.html) _Rainbow Six Siege_. It was "developed exclusively" for mobile devices and features a trio of 5v5 multiplayer modes. There's a team deathmatch, of course, and a pair of bomb-defusing games that are riffs on a pre-existing mode from _Siege._

_Rainbow Six Mobile_ offers access to a bunch of maps, including some that will be familiar to fans of the franchise. There are more than 20 operators to choose from and Ubisoft promises it'll be adding more content with each new season.

The company is rolling the game out early in some parts of the world. It's already playable in Poland, France, Canada and parts of Latin America. Everyone else has to wait until February.
