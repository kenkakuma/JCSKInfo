Uber is apparently feeling generous this holiday season. The company is launching [family sharing for Uber One members](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/membership-updates/), allowing individuals to add another adult to their account for free. They can also include an unlimited number of teens. 

Anyone added to the membership can access all of the same benefits, including free delivery. They will also earn unique credits for rides. You can attach someone to your membership by clicking Account and then [Uber One](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-sues-uber-over-claims-the-company-makes-subscriptions-hard-to-cancel-191552906.html). From there, you can tap manage membership and then family sharing.

Uber is also giving members additional perks, like prioritized complimentary upgrades. The company claims that it will upgrade over one million rides for members between December 2 and 25. Plus, members traveling between today and Thursday for Thanksgiving should get 10 percent off if booking an Uber Black to or from an airport. 

Tech lovers with an Uber One subscription will be happy to hear that you can get early access to $25 off if you spend $75 or more at Best Buy — through [Uber Eats](https://www.engadget.com/apps/uber-accuses-doordash-of-anti-competitive-practices-in-a-lawsuit-130032964.html), of course.
