As part of an AI-focused reorganization, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan [told employees](https://sources.news/p/youtube-announces-ai-reorg-and-layoffs) that it will offer voluntary buyouts, according to an internal company memo. At the same time, he emphasized that there would be no specific role eliminations as part of new structure.

"Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform," Mohan wrote. "We also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a voluntary exit Program." 

The restructuring is designed to help YouTube focus on fast-growing areas like AI while "driving faster decision making and execution," the memo states. To that end, the platform is organizing into three separate product organizations: viewer products, creator and community products, and subscription products. 

Viewer products will focus on the viewer experience by making improvements to search & discovery, engagement, the living room experience and "our foundation of responsibility." Creator and community products, meanwhile, is "driving creation through genAI tools, Shorts, Live and creator support. Subscription products, as you'd expect, will operate around subscription growth across Music, Premium and OTT (YouTube TV) platforms. 

Mohan noted that YouTube has been the number one streamer in the US for the last two years. So far, it has signed up 125 million Premium and Music subscribers, along with 8 million YouTube TV subs. The platform has paid out $100 billion to its ecosystem (presumably, creators and recording artists). 

YouTube isn't the only tech giant reducing headcount while citing AI as an impetus. Amazon recently announced that it had [laid off 14,000 people](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html), while citing the need to be "lean" due to transformative technology like AI. Meanwhile, YouTube parent Alphabet announced its first-ever $100 billion quarter, largely on the strength of cloud services and search.
