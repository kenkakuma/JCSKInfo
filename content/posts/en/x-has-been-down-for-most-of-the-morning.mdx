X is still struggling with an outage that has intermittently taken the service offline and made it slow to load for much of the morning. According to X’s developer platform [page](https://docs.x.com/status), there is an [ongoing incident](https://docs.x.com/incidents) related to streaming endpoints that’s caused increased errors. The incident started at 7:39AM PT, according to the page.

That roughly coincides with a spike in reports at [Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/). The issues seems to be somewhat intermittent. At some points, X’s website has loaded partially and only shown older posts. At other times, the app and website have failed to load at all.

As of 9:30AM PT, X’s Explore and trending pages were loading, but the “following” tab wasn’t showing posts and instead suggested users “find some people and topic to follow” (as shown in the screenshot below).

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the outage. As _TechCrunch_ [notes](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/x-is-down-for-the-second-time-this-week/), this is the [second time](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/x-down-thousands-users-downdetector-shows-2026-01-13/) this week that X has experienced significant issues. The service also went down for many users around the world on Tuesday.

But while the current issues are widespread, it does seem that some posts are still managing to go through. Rival Bluesky, which earlier in the week changed its profile picture on X to its butterfly logo [in a bikini](https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html), to took the opportunity to throw some shade.
