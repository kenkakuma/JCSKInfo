CES 2026 is [right around the corner](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html), and the pre-show hype cycle/ early reveals suggest, yes, there’s going to be an awful lot of AI-powered insert-product-category-here alongside, thankfully, some major announcements from the likes of Intel, Sony and NVIDIA.

Intel is finally unveiling its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips. The first chips built on Intel’s 2nm process could offer a 50 percent performance boost, which is sorely needed amid intense competition. NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang is taking the stage for a keynote expected to feature a lot of AI hype, while AMD’s Lisa Su will likely counter with new Ryzen 9000-series chips and the latest on AI upscaling tech.

LG

Over the years, CES has consistently been _the_ show for TV innovation and heady next-gen displays. This year, we’ll be talking a lot about Micro RGB. LG is introducing a new Micro RGB Evo panel with over 1,000 dimming zones, while Samsung plans to launch a full range of Micro RGB TVs from 55 inches to 115 inches. In 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. The company has trademarked “True RGB,” which could become what Sony calls its spin on RGB displays.

We’ll be covering all the keynotes, press conferences and big reveals in person. And figuring which of the 100s of AI-branded devices and gadgets are worth reporting on.

I’m also taking bets on the most niche celebrity appearance/endorsement at CES 2026. We’ve seen 50 Cent, Big Bird, Martha Stewart, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Guillermo del Toro, Justin Bieber and will.i.am (_multiple_ times), so who will join this pantheon of stars?

Samsung

It isn’t just TVs with Samsung. The company has already teased a pair of new understated speakers. Likely inspired by the Samsung Frame, the new Wi-Fi speakers, called the Music Studio 5 and 7, blend into your living room. The Music Studio 5 has a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, with a built-in waveguide to deliver better sound. The Music Studio 7 comes with a 3.1.1-channel spatial audio with top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers. No prices yet. Expect to hear more at CES itself or once the speakers arrive in stores. And as the press image above suggests, we can't wait to sit stoically in front of one, with a glass of water (?).

### And a 1-inch sensor, 200MP telephoto camera and 3,500 nit display.

Xiaomi

Xiaomi’s latest smartphone is once again a spec beast. It features a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. And it also has an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring. This surrounds the rear camera unit.

Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness.

But the camera features are the standout elements. The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well, Leica touches: a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on the front, textured edges and film simulations, like Leica’s Monopan 50 black and white. Xiaomi says the zoom ring “\[eliminates\] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm.” It can also be reprogrammed for manual focus.

Xiaomi’s 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra start at CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995), on par with the latest high-end Pixel 10s and Galaxy S25s.

## [You may soon be able to change your Gmail address](https://www.engadget.com/computing/you-may-soon-be-able-to-change-your-gmail-address-165633905.html)

### A Google support page in Hindi says the feature is ‘gradually rolling out to all users.’

A Google support page in Hindi indicates the ability to change your Gmail address might be coming. The feature would allow you to replace your current @gmail.com address with another. Your old address would remain active as an alias on the account, and all your data would stick around, unaffected. The support page (translated) says “the ability to change your Google Account email address is gradually rolling out to all users.”
