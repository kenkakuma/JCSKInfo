Nintendo capped off today’s partner-focused [Nintendo Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ym9SCKFpc&t=1s) with a flurry of Bethesda-related [announcements](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-get-switch-2-release-dates-150023624.html), but arguably the most interesting game of the showcase appeared right at the start.

First announced at the beginning of the year, _Orbitals_ is a two-player puzzle adventure game in which you and your co-op partner play as the intergalactic explorers Maki and Omura, on a mission to save their home in the stars from an incoming cosmic storm. Gameplay-wise, _Orbitals_ looks like it’s at least partly inspired by the likes of [_It Takes Two_](https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html) and _Split Fiction_, but really what really stands out here is the 90s anime-inspired visuals.

The game is absolutely dripping in style, and somehow looks just as good in motion as it does in cutscenes. Describing it as a playable Saturday morning cartoon is getting into cliche territory, but _Orbitals_ _really_ nails its aesthetic.

It will be a tall order for any game like this to clear the impossibly high bar for creative co-op gameplay that Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios has set in recent years, but _Orbitals_ looks like it could be worth experiencing for its visuals alone.

Nintendo has managed to nab this one as a [Switch 2](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-virtual-boy-is-a-tribute-to-nintendos-wackiest-console-140000003.html) exclusive, which you can either play locally or online, and thanks to the console's GameShare feature, only one person needs to own the game for the latter.   

_Orbitals_ arrives at some point during summer 2026.
