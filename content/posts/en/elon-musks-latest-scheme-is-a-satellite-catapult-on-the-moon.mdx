With his newfound [focus on the Moon](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-is-pivoting-to-focus-on-a-moon-base-before-mars-141851264.html), Elon musk is making some wild new plans. In an xAI meeting with employees, Musk said the company needed to build an AI satellite factory on the moon with a gigantic catapult to launch them into space, according to audio heard by [_The New York Times_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=f13962c0-32f8-4f7b-9054-39a4e4268d88&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+New+York+Times&linkText=The+New+York+Times&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzEwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWx1bmFyLWZhY3RvcnkuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjEzOTYyYzAtMzJmOC00ZjdiLTkwNTQtMzlhNGU0MjY4ZDg4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzEwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWx1bmFyLWZhY3RvcnkuaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAAUNC9cQCHrG6LD8Vn_q40bXhIw9uZd8cHhKkP8i56sX6&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F02%2F10%2Ftechnology%2Felon-musk-lunar-factory.html). 

All of that would be part of the billionaire's plans to create a massive orbiting AI "data center" that uses satellites powered by the sun and kept cool by the vacuum of space (a bad plan, [some experts say](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=f13962c0-32f8-4f7b-9054-39a4e4268d88&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Independent&linkText=some+experts+say&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9zcGFjZS9lbG9uLW11c2stc3BhY2V4LWFpLWRhdGEtY2VudGVycy1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWIyOTE0MzgyLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImYxMzk2MmMwLTMyZjgtNGY3Yi05MDU0LTM5YTRlNDI2OGQ4OCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY28udWsvc3BhY2UvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNwYWNleC1haS1kYXRhLWNlbnRlcnMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1iMjkxNDM4Mi5odG1sIn0&signature=AQAAASv_7dikwMZ6yBENHtWFcFHLJSgEyl2IA1-GN6i49SZe&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fspace%2Felon-musk-spacex-ai-data-centers-satellites-b2914382.html)). Any satellites launched from the Moon would presumably orbit the Moon as well, though Musk didn't provide any additional details. 

"You have to go to the moon" in order to build the required AI capabilities, Musk told employees. "It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen." 

Such a catapult would certainly need to be powerful — though the Moon has only one-sixth the gravity of Earth, the minimum escape velocity required for orbit is still around 3,800 MPH or five times the speed of sound. That's currently possible with electromagnetic [railguns](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/navy-railgun-battleships/) that launch projectiles at speeds up to Mach 8.8, though any satellite launched by such a device would need to withstand acceleration forces around 10,000 g or more. 

It's fun to think about it, but there are a few _tiny_ steps required first. That starts with orbiting the Moon and eventually landing on the surface. Then you'd need to build a colony, followed by a factory, all of which would require a large number of manned and unmanned expeditions. As a reminder, we haven't been to the moon for over 50 years and none of the colony or factory stuff has ever been done.  

Early last year Musk said in [a post on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324) that SpaceX would be going "straight to Mars" and that "the Moon is a distraction." However, the CEO apparently shifted his near-term priorities to building a "self-growing city on the Moon" because it's a more achievable target. In a [post on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577), Musk said the company could complete this in less than 10 years, while doing the same on Mars would take over 20 years.

Any estimates from Musk himself certainly need to be treated skeptically, though. Elon once [said in 2017](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk.html) that SpaceX would send cargo missions to Mars by 2022 aboard a rocket that's still being tested in 2026.
