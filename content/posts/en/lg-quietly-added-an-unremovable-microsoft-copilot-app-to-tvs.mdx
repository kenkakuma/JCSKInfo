Microsoft made a big punt this year with Copilot. The company put its AI chatbot into a [special line of laptops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html) and has also tried to integrate it into other tech products. The latest place you may find Copilot is on your LG smart television, whether you want it or not.

Several LG smart TV owners have taken to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/tv-providers/lg-tv-update-adds-non-removable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-webos) over the past few days to complain that they suddenly have a Copilot app on the device and cannot uninstall it. Two _Engadget_ staffers discovered the app on a 2022 LG OLED and a 2023 UA8000. They confirmed that the app can't be removed, although they were able to hide it from the home screen. One other person from our team also has a 2022 LG OLED but isn't seeing Copilot, so your mileage may vary based on what permissions and privacy settings you already have set up with LG.

LG said during the 2025 CES season that it would have a Copilot-powered AI Search in its next wave of TV models, but putting in a permanent AI fixture is sure to leave a bad taste in many customers' mouths, particularly since Copilot [hasn't been particularly popular](https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html) among people using AI assistants.
