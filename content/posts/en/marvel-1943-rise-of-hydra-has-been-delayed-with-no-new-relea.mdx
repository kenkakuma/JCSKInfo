_Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra_ has been delayed again. The project had already [been pushed back](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-delayed-to-2026-185945301.html) in May from a planned 2025 release date to a rough early 2026 window. In a [post](https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986539089164972440%7Ctwgr%5E050686ae77fd6ad94788b2e51d30b65a6f4bd35a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fmarvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-again%2F) on X today, Skydance Games said the title won't be ready for even longer. "We've made the decision to shift our release window beyond 2026," the statement reads.

Amy Hennig's studio, which is [part of Skydance](https://www.engadget.com/amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-marvel-partnership-172714404.html), is the main driver of the project, which we know is a story-driven title with a quartet of Marvel characters in occupied Paris during World War II. Hennig was a core part of the creative team behind the Uncharted series, and was more recently a story consultant on [Forspoken](https://www.engadget.com/forspoken-review-ps5-pc-a-magical-world-with-several-cracks-140051257.html). She's also been long tied to some mysterious [Star Wars title](https://www.engadget.com/amy-hennig-star-wars-game-announced-164331233.html), but that game has also been pretty light on details for a few years. 

That's two high-profile AAA delays in one afternoon. Fans worldwide will have to wait longer for the eventual arrival of [_Grand Theft Auto 6_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html). Rockstar's eventual mega-hit has been pushed to a November 19, 2026 launch date.
