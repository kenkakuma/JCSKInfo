The price for a PS4 copy of the relatively obscure Star Wars racing game, _Star Wars Racer Revenge_, has dramatically increased in the last few days because of the game’s use in the latest PlayStation 5 jailbreak, [_Eurogamer_ reports](https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge). The PS2 game was originally released in 2002, and was ported to PS4 by Limited Run Games [in 2019](https://limitedrungames.com/blogs/news/hone-your-podracing-skills-in-star-wars-racer-revenge). Its role as a key ingredient in the jailbreaking process [was announced](https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20) on December 31.

Interested jailbreakers need _Racer Revenge_ to jailbreak PS5 12.00 firmware because of a bug in the game's Hall of Fame feature, according to _Eurogamer_. The bug makes it possible to inject new code into Sony's console, and because the PS5 is able to load and play PS4 discs, _Star Wars Racer Revenge_ is an easier method to pull the jailbreak off. Retail releases of games are a common way to execute exploits and hacks because, unlike digital copies, they can’t be directly patched.

While the PS4 version of _Star Wars Racer Revenge_ was available for anywhere between [$14.99](https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4) to [$37.50](https://limitedrungames.com/products/limited-run-290-star-wars-racer-revenge-premium-edition-ps4) when it went on sale originally, used copies are currently listed for as high as $411 [on eBay](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5a36d98f-e3c9-4ccc-96f8-f261b8484c73&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ef903ed8-28dd-49c4-af49-009dde354f12&featureId=text-link&merchantName=eBay&linkText=on+eBay&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYmF5LmNvbS9zY2gvaS5odG1sP19ua3c9c3Rhcit3YXJzK3JhY2VyK3JldmVuZ2UrcHM0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjkwM2VkOC0yOGRkLTQ5YzQtYWY0OS0wMDlkZGUzNTRmMTIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmViYXkuY29tL3NjaC9pLmh0bWw_X25rdz1zdGFyK3dhcnMrcmFjZXIrcmV2ZW5nZStwczQifQ&signature=AQAAARZpFiZnYcgSgN9U9tTUARfBrdPbYJqVuntK1lqsUl4P&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Dstar%2Bwars%2Bracer%2Brevenge%2Bps4). Sellers are naturally trying to capitalize on the game's new position in the jailbreaking meta and raising the price accordingly. Of course, it helps that there's only a small number of copies to go around.

As the company's name suggests, Limited Run Games releases old games in limited quantities as collector items. The company only ever made 8,500 copies of _Racer Revenge_ per [its own data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ko7iYqZDcr5Leq6I_1byupsVcyFjFZDYItTK5qhOwxk/edit?gid=0#gid=0), so the game is already rare in some sense, and now expensive to boot while there's interest in the PS5 jailbreak.
