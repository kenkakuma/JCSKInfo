Google Photos introduced a fresh batch of a half-dozen AI-powered features today. First is personalized photo editing. Using "Help me edit," you can now make adjustments to portraits and group shots, such as removing sunglasses or fixing closed eyes. Google says that the AI uses other images stored in a user's face groups to make accurate changes to the people in your photo library. The "Help me edit" voice- or text-controlled photo editing tool is also starting to roll out to iOS users in the US.

Next, the company is integrating its [Nano Banana](https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-editing-is-coming-to-search-notebooklm-and-photos-184111046.html) image editor into Google Photos. Users can make open-ended restyling requests in the "Help me edit" tool, such as making a picture look like a Renaissance painting or a mosaic. Nano Banana will also power a new Create with AI section, which will provide templates based on popular requests to jumpstart the AI editing process. This feature will roll out to the Create tab for Android users in the US and India beginning next week. Later on, Google will begin personalizing these templates to the particular hobbies and experiences captured in a person's photo library. 

Following a ["pause"](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-has-paused-the-ask-photos-rollout-182409437.html) and [restart](https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-tweaked-its-ai-powered-ask-photos-feature-and-restarted-its-rollout-192505246.html) in June, the Ask Photos tool is also expanding. The feature for AI-powered searches of the Google photo library will be available in more than 100 new markets and will support 17 new languages starting this week. 

Finally, Google Photos is getting a new Ask button aimed at delivering more details about a specific image. After tapping the button, a user can type questions about the content of the photo, find similar pictures in their library or begin describing desired edits. This feature is rolling out just in the US for now, but on both Android and iOS platforms.
