ASUS appears to be shifting its business operations away from smartphones. According to [translations](https://www.pcmag.com/news/asus-confirms-it-wont-launch-phones-in-2026-may-leave-android-altogether?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&test_variant=A) of recent quotes from Chairman Jonney Shih, the company does not plan to release new phone models in the future. The chairman did not confirm whether smartphones would be completely phased out, but he did acknowledge that possibility. Whatever direction ASUS takes, its existing phones will continue to receive software updates and warranty assistance. Shih suggested that its future plans may include a shift into AI-related projects such as robotics or smartglasses.

Previous [reports](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260102PD236/smartphone-asus-taiwan-mobile-market.html) hinted that ASUS would not introduce any smartphones in 2026, but Shih's recent comments indicate that the pause may stretch longer than a year. We've reached out to ASUS for additional comment and will update if the company shares any further information. 

ASUS had plenty of other updates emerging from CES at the start of the month unrelated to smartphones, such as [dual-screen](https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-asus-zenbook-duo-got-a-fantastic-redesign-for-ces-2026-173000392.html) [laptops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html) and a pair of [gaming smartglasses](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html). So if it does decide to leave that product segment, there will still be other ASUS-branded gear on the market.
