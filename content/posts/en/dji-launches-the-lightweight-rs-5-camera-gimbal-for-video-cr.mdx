DJI just revealed the RS 5 camera gimbal, a new entry in its long-standing Ronan Series. The RS 5 is lightweight, at around three pounds, with a maximum payload of nearly seven pounds.

This gimbal offers what DJI calls "enhanced intelligent subject tracking." The tracking [was already impressive](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-8-gimbal-adds-pet-tracking-and-apple-dockkit-support-120032512.html) with some of the company's older offerings, so any improvement will be icing on the cake. A new tracking module lets videographers frame live footage and follow subjects directly from an included touchscreen, all without having to fiddle with the actual camera.

The tracking module also offers the ability to follow more than people. It can track pets, vehicles or just about any other object. It can also help maintain a locked focus on a human subject up to 10 meters away.

The RS 5 includes the company's latest stabilization algorithm, which DJI says lets videographers "effortlessly achieve complicated camera movements, such as surround shots, reverse tracking or single-person fixed-camera tracking." It's also great for when the cameraperson is capturing footage while walking or running.

It's been designed to carry a wide range of mainstream mirrorless cameras and lens combinations and can switch to vertical shooting without additional accessories. There's a nifty little briefcase handle for capturing footage from above or below.

The RS 5 delivers up to 14 hours of use per charge and can be fully charged in just an hour. Video shoots can take forever, so this is a welcome bit of news. For true marathons, there's a separate enhanced battery grip accessory that extends the runtime to 30 hours.

DJI

The standard DJI RS 5 includes the gimbal, a quick-open tripod, quick-release plates, a regular battery grip and some other useful accessories. That pack costs around $680. The combo pack includes all of the above, plus the enhanced tracking module, a carrying case and an electronic briefcase handle. That costs around $859.

Now for the bad news. We don't have a US release date or even any information as to if it will be available here. Engadget has reached out to DJI for more information. The company's drones were [recently banned from being imported to the US](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/why-dji-drones-might-be-banned-in-the-us-170030273.html). This only impacts newly-released models and shouldn't impact gimbals or anything like that.
