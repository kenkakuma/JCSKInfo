Based on what we've seen, _Replaced_ is a [gaming art director's dream](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-again-this-time-until-spring-2026-182908044.html). The long-delayed indie title has lush pixel-art environments, set in a cyberpunk fever dream. And now we finally know when it's arriving. Mark your calendar for March 12, 2026.

If you've been following _Replaced_'s journey, you'll know that's [four years after its original release date](https://www.engadget.com/replaced-game-xbox-windows-182032719.html). Shit happens! In this case, that included having to relocate from Belarus to Cyprus after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. It will be the first game from developer Sad Cat Studios. Thunderful Games is publishing.

_Replaced_ is set in a dystopian alternate 1980s America. In this timeline, nuclear winter has reshaped the world. "Step into a world where neon lights flicker over rain-soaked streets, industrial decay meets futuristic technology, and every shadow holds a secret," the blurb [reads](https://thunderfulgames.com/replaced-is-releasing-on-pc-and-xbox-on-march-12th-2026/). You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI unwillingly trapped in a human body.

As for gameplay, it's a 2.5D cinematic action platformer. "Chain precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks to take down enemies in high-intensity encounters while keeping the flow of exploration," the description reads. Expect plenty of running, climbing and kicking ass.

You can see some of the dazzling art direction, fluid movement, and smooth combat in the new trailer below. You can wishlist _Replaced_ now through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/) or [Xbox](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7815a8a9-f747-43f6-a902-15af064810a9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZXBsYWNlZC85TVoxQzhEMjZCN0giLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc4MTVhOGE5LWY3NDctNDNmNi1hOTAyLTE1YWYwNjQ4MTBhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVwbGFjZWQvOU1aMUM4RDI2QjdIIn0&signature=AQAAAf3XJPTu8sD-mVPvaOxDyPbUSNpmo7ty_B5F78kea5ZE&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Freplaced%2F9MZ1C8D26B7H).
