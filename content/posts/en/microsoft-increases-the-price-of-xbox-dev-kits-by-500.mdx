Players aren't the only ones facing higher price tags from Xbox. According to a report by [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers), Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox Development Kit from $1,500 to $2,000. That's a 33 percent jump in cost for these custom hardware kits, which are essential for devs to make and test games for release on the console. 

"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments," Microsoft said in an email sent to Xbox devs and seen by _The Verge_. "We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts." Although the macroeconomics in question are almost certainly the tariffs enacted by the US, it appears this is a blanket increase that will impact developers in other countries as well. The new kit costs appear to be effective immediately. 

The change caps off a series of price increases for the Xbox ecosystem. [Game Pass](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html) prices recently rose, with the Ultimate tier now costing $30 a month compared to the previous $20. And Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox twice this year, [once](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsoft-is-raising-prices-on-the-xbox-series-s-and-series-x-132004594.html) in May and [again](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html) in September. Between these additional expenses and the little matter of [cutting](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-percent-of-its-global-workforce-154755787.html) [thousands](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html) of gaming jobs earlier this year, a lot of us are [giving up on Xbox](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/why-im-breaking-up-with-xbox-160000545.html) before Microsoft can disappoint us yet again.
