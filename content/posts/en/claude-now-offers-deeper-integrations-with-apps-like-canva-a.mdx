Anthropic has been building out support for third-party apps inside of Claude. As of today, the chatbot can now connect to platforms like Slack and [Canva](https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-ai-now-integrates-with-canva-201808571.html), fetching up files from inside those apps or performing tasks within them on a user's behalf.

For instance, when connected to Box, Claude can now search for files, preview documents inline and answer questions about the content in front of you. Meanwhile, with a connection to Asana, it can now turn chats into projects, tasks and timelines your co-workers can then find and interact with on the project management app. 

Box and Asana are just two of the platforms adding deeper integrations with Claude today. In total, there are nine launch partners, with some of the more notable ones including Canva, Figma and Slack.   

As with Anthropic's past integrations, the new functionality is powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP is a technology Anthropic released in [fall 2024](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) to make it easier for third-party platforms to connect their systems to Claude. Since then, the protocol has become an industry standard. OpenAI, for instance, [adopted MCP last year](https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-support-for-remote-mcp-servers-image-generation-code-interpreter-and-more-in-the-responses-api/1266973), and has been building additional support since then. At the end of last year, Anthropic donated the protocol to the [Linux Foundation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation). The company says AI platforms will be able to bring similar integrations to their own products since they're built on a new open extension designed by Anthropic.
