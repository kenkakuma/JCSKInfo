The Pixel 10a is official, though details are limited. On Wednesday, Google posted a [teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIkj4yz2t_E) showing the mid-range phone dancing around colorful backgrounds. You can pre-order the Pixel 10a on February 18.

Google hasn't yet revealed the phone's specs. In the short video, we can see a blue model that's virtually indistinguishable on the outside from the Pixel 9a. And [alleged leaks](https://www.droid-life.com/2025/12/10/pixel-10a-specs-verizon-certification/) point to a phone with few changes on the inside. That (unconfirmed) list includes a 6.285-inch display, dual rear cameras (48MP wide and 13MP ultra-wide) and a 5,100mAh battery.

The teaser's tagline appears to be an attempt to assure Pixel fans that there will, in fact, be meaningful upgrades. "A phone with more in store, in store soon," it reads. Hopefully, its pricing and specs will be "in store" for us soon as well.

In the meantime, you can visit the [Google Pixel website](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=47408a47-7be0-49f0-86aa-563efadfdd37&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=e4f8c6e1-86f6-4eb6-8637-c5d65f1618d5&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Google+Store&linkText=Google+Pixel+website&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcGhvbmVzP2hsPWVuLVVTJnBsaT0xIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNGY4YzZlMS04NmY2LTRlYjYtODYzNy1jNWQ2NWYxNjE4ZDUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RvcmUuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9waG9uZXM_aGw9ZW4tVVMmcGxpPTEifQ&signature=AQAAAZ1Vm5lpYWod0_LvTdvGwlWjY-WJ4GvbotaapJkqKBb9&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fcategory%2Fphones%3Fhl%3Den-US%26pli%3D1) to register for more info.
