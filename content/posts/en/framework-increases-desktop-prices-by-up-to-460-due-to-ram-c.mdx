Computer brand Framework has hiked the prices on RAM for its Desktop systems and Mainframes in response to rising costs with its suppliers. Compared with when the Desktops were [announced](https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-builds-its-own-modular-desktop-191211936.html), the 32GB and 64GB options each cost $40 more, but its 128GB variation now costs an extra $460. The [current pricing](https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new) for machines is $1,139 for 32GB, $1,639 for 64GB or $2,459 for 128GB. 

Since the company began altering its pricing structure last month, it [committed](https://frame.work/blog/updates-on-memory-pricing-and-navigating-the-volatile-memory-market) to remaining transparent with customers about the changes happening to RAM prices. Framework also said it would reduce prices again once the market calms down. The original prices will be honored for any existing pre-orders. 

One of the big takeaways from [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/general/all-the-tech-and-gadgets-announced-at-ces-2026-130124023.html) was that RAM is going to be [an expensive commodity](https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html) this year. The rising costs are largely in response to artificial intelligence projects, such as the rush to build data centers. As a result, buyers who take the modular approach may want to upgrade less costly components for better specs without making the increasingly hefty investment in memory.
