A Google support page in Hindi says the ability to change your Gmail address is on the way. The feature would allow you to replace your current @gmail.com address with another. Your old address would remain active as an alias on the account, and all your data would stick around, unaffected.

The [support page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870) (translated) says that "the ability to change your Google Account email address is gradually rolling out to all users." The change was first spotted on a Google Pixel [forum](https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453) on Telegram and was first reported in the press by [_9to5Google_](https://9to5google.com/2025/12/24/google-change-gmail-addresses/).

Google hasn't made a formal announcement about the change. The English version of the support page still says you usually can't change your @gmail.com address. Up to this point, Google has only allowed address changes for non-gmail.com addresses.

Engadget reached out to Google for confirmation. We'll update this story if we hear back.

When the feature (presumably) rolls out broadly, you'll change it through your account settings. Sign in to your Google account, then go to **Manage your Google account > Personal info > Google Account email**. If you don't see the option to change it, then you'll have to wait.
