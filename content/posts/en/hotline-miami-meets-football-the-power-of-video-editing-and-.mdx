Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As always, we've got a bunch of neat games to tell you about. Perhaps I'll tear myself away from playing as Chappell Roan in _Fortnite_ or [Jetpack Cat in _Overwatch_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-will-drop-the-2-as-jetpack-cat-and-four-other-heroes-arrive-on-february-10-184500327.html) long enough to check more of them out.

Thanks to the folks at [_Aftermath_](https://aftermath.site/generative-ai-llm-video-game-sam-altman-ed-zitron/), I learned about a short, text-based game from Woe Industries from a while back called _You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI_. Surprisingly enough, you take on the role of a venture capitalist who has plowed gobs of money into genAI technology and might be starting to have doubts about that investment. Other characters warn you about the dangers of the tech and real-life headlines showing the impact of genAI hallucinations pop up. It's tagged as a horror game, for what it's worth. 

It's both satirical and all too real, and it's pretty funny. Plus, any game that allows me to yell at [Noam Chomsky](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/epstein-files-noam-chomsky) is A-OK in my book. You can play _You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI_ for free on [Itch.io](http://woe-industries.itch.io/you-have-billions-invested-in-generative-ai).

## New releases

_Tackle for Loss_ had a very timely arrival this week, just ahead of a certain other big, real-life game. This is a football-themed take on action-heavy, top-down games like _Hotline Miami_. Developer Indifferent Penguin took some inspiration from the Taken film series as well — you take on the role of a CTE-afflicted former football player who sets out to rescue his kidnapped daughter.

The combat sounds pretty interesting here. You need to clear out all of the bad guys on each floor of a multistory building before you can progress, but you only have four offensive actions at your disposal each time (this draws from the four-down format of football). You'll need to plan things out before you go on the attack, not least because your character and the enemies all die in a single hit.

_Tackle for Loss_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/). It'll usually run you $11, but it's 15 percent off until February 12. 

_Trust Me, I Nailed It_ is an intriguing turn-based strategy game from Team Afternoon and publisher Jungle Game Lab. A useless warrior hires you as a video editor to make them look like a true hero capable of slaying any beast. 

Enemy attacks and other actions appear on the edit timeline as pre-recorded footage, and the idea is to plot out the warrior's movements around those. You have post-processing visual effects tricks at your disposal, so you can let the warrior teleport and convert low-power strikes into critical hits.

It's a fun idea, and a reminder (as if we should need one in the current climate) not to always take videos at face value. _Trust Me, I Nailed It_ is on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/) now and it's free-to-play.

_Tomb of the Bloodletter_ is a spin on the roguelike deckbuilder genre that I haven't really seen before. Your deck consists of magic powers that are applied to letters of the alphabet. Spelling out words using these Magicks can result in powerful combinations, particularly if you use the same letter multiple times. That's right, this is a typing game — a roguelike deckbuilder that the likes of [_Wordle_](https://tech.yahoo.com/puzzles/wordle/) players might be interested in.

It's really about coming up with words that put the right letters in a specific order. For instance, certain letters are more effective if you place them at the end of a word. So, this should get your brain ticking.  

_Tomb of the Bloodletter_ — from Ethan's Secretions and indie.io — debuted during the [Steam Typing Fest](https://store.steampowered.com/category/typing). It'll typically cost $8, but there's a 20 percent discount until February 19.

## Upcoming 

_Shadowstone_ is an upcoming turn-based tactical co-op roguelike for up to four players from developer Secret Door and Dreamhaven (Blizzard co-founder and ex-CEO Mike Morhaime's company). It's set in the same universe as Secret Door's [_Sunderfolk_](http://sunderfolk)_._ 

The action plays out on a hexagonal board with randomized rooms and enemies. Positioning will be key, and finding synergies between the abilities of the playable characters will put you in good stead.

_Shadowstone_ will hit [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4180840/Shadowstone/) in early access later this year for $15. It's also coming to the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/shadowstone-cf61b1).

Meanwhile, a major update for _Sunderfolk_ is set to go live on March 10. It will introduce a new tank-style character and two fresh sets of missions. Secret Door will also add two much-requested features to PC versions: online multiplayer and — so you don't have to use your phone to play the game anymore — mouse and keyboard controls.

I really loved _Planet of Lana_ and the sequel is among my most-anticipated games of this year. There's now a release date for the upcoming puzzle platformer. Wishfully and Thunderful Publishing are bringing it to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2997230/Planet_of_Lana_II/), [Xbox](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=3ea0dfb8-acbd-4fa1-829e-1e97482e9485&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9wbGFuZXQtb2YtbGFuYS1paS85cGw4OWI5aGN6OXciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjNlYTBkZmI4LWFjYmQtNGZhMS04MjllLTFlOTc0ODJlOTQ4NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcGxhbmV0LW9mLWxhbmEtaWkvOXBsODliOWhjejl3In0&signature=AQAAAZz_irIxqadblsqR0L9BBICQ80MEzm6QmzxWzBwzF2Mt&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fplanet-of-lana-ii%2F9pl89b9hcz9w), [PlayStation](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011317/) and Nintendo Switch on March 5. It'll also be on Game Pass on day one.

A _Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf_ demo will hit Steam, Xbox and PlayStation on February 11. It will arrive on Switch a bit later.

Is _Sticker/Ball_ the first _Ball x Pit_\-like? I'm not entirely sure. Still, it is now firmly on my radar. Instead of firing balls at a horde of constantly-advancing enemies, here you'll shoot them at dice to earn points. You'll unlock stickers that can be applied to said dice and they’ll interact with each other too. For instance, spiders can create webs and these can catch flies that are attracted to poop stickers. 

The trailer describes another interaction, "frog jumped and triggered cigarette pack." Frogs can also hijack spaceships, apparently, and there's a bouncing DVD (well, "VID") logo. There are more than 100 types of stickers and dozens of different enemies.

I don't really understand what's going on in the trailer, but it's somehow making my brain happy, so this is going on my wishlist. Solo dev Bilge is behind _Sticker/Ball_, which is coming to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/_STICKERBALL/) soon through the help of publisher Future Friends Games. A demo is available now, so that's my weekend sorted.

_Skate City_ has long been one of the [best games on Apple Arcade](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html). Its creator, Daniel Zeller, (Zellah Games) has revealed a new project. _Skate Style_ is billed as a "next-gen skateboarding game with high-end graphics." You'll be able to take to the virtual streets of Barcelona and Prague to show off your best moves. 

What could help _Skate Style_ really stand out from the pack is the animation editor, which enables you to create completely new tricks. The game is slated to have an "advanced" character creation tool as well as mod support, so there'll be a high level of customization available. 

A _Skate Style_ demo is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862790/Skate_Style/) now. The full game should land on PC later this year. Here's hoping the soundtrack can match up to those from the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series.

_Crimson Capes_ is billed as a 2D Soulslike action RPG with four playable characters, elemental magic, more than 25 bosses, swordfighting, lots of secrets, co-op, optional hunts with randomized dungeons and invasions from other players. That all sounds neat enough, but most exciting to me here is the pixel-art, rotoscoped animation work. It looks modern and retro at the same time, and I'd love to see this sort of style in more games. I also dig that you get a PDF instruction manual and game guide as well as a printable world map when you buy the game.

You (and I) won't have to wait long to play _Crimson Capes_, which is from Poor Locke. It's coming to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488540/Crimson_Capes/) on February 12 for $15, though you'll get 10 percent off if you pick it up within the first nine days. Console versions are in the pipeline too.
