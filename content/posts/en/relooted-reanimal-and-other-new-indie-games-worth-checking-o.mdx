Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. A whole bunch of compelling games arrived this week, and Sony dropped some news about more that are on the way to PS5 and other platforms during its [State of Play stream on Thursday](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html). 

For one thing, I didn’t have a [prequel for _Neva_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-neva-prequel-is-arriving-next-week-081239628.html), one of my favorite games of the last few years on my bingo card. I’m very much looking forward to checking out that DLC next week. 

It’s really neat that Motion Twin and Evil Empire — the studios behind _Dead Cells_ and its expansions, respectively — are getting to make a [proper Castlevania game](https://www.engadget.com/dead-cells-castlevania-dlc-trailer-release-window-012349322.html). While it might not be developing many games in-house anymore, giving external studios the chance to run with its franchises is a very smart move on Konami’s part. Not least because we’re getting a [Silent Hill game set in Scotland as well](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-townfall-takes-the-series-trademark-fog-to-an-eerie-coastal-community-233324897.html).

I’ve had _Big Walk_ on my radar since the game was first shown off [at The Game Awards a couple of years back](https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html). This is a co-op multiplayer game from _Untitled Goose Game_ studio House House and publisher Panic in which you'll go on adventures with your friends and help each other through puzzles and other challenges using voice, text chat and gestures. You can just hang out with your buds and watch the sunset or put their binoculars into the ocean too.

Expect _Big Walk_ to arrive later this year on PS5 (including as a Monthly Game for all PS Plus members), Steam and Epic Games Store. There will be support for cross-platform play between PS5 and PC.

Also, Remedy Entertainment is technically an indie studio. As such, I can mention here that I cannot wait for _Control Resonant_, which is probably going to break my brain with all the perspective shifting Remedy showed off in [the gameplay trailer](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html). 

## New releases

As with any successful heist, planning and execution are equally paramount in [_Relooted_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html). Setting things up properly before hightailing it out of a museum with artifacts reminds me a bit of _Teardown_ albeit without all the voxel destruction. But _Relooted_ is a lot more than that. 

It’s an anti-colonialist story in which parkour enthusiast Nomali and her crew take back African artifacts (all of which exist in real life) from Western museums. I did encounter some performance issues while playing on PC, but that didn't take too much away from the enjoyable, in-the-moment action and having to adjust escape routes on the fly when things go awry. Nor did the framerate drops detract one bit from the important story that South African studio Nyamakop is telling here.

_Relooted_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/), [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/relooted-89fdd7) and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6ffef56b-cf61-4e51-b729-b51fe5f828a9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZWxvb3RlZC85cHBwNTM0NGIzbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmZmVmNTZiLWNmNjEtNGU1MS1iNzI5LWI1MWZlNWY4MjhhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVsb290ZWQvOXBwcDUzNDRiM2xzIn0&signature=AQAAAUVLf7VY__JniAzAb0NzQAwzjMV2IK4G3SSylF-wCMTp&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Frelooted%2F9ppp5344b3ls). It typically costs $15, but there's a 10 percent discount on Steam until February 24. It's available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

_Little Nightmares_ and _Little Nightmares 2_ developer Tarsier Studios is back with another slice of atmospheric horror. In _Reanimal_, two siblings set out to save their missing friends and escape from an island they once called home. However, they'll have to face a litany of dangers, including a lot of creepy creatures. 

I haven't played _Reanimal_ yet, but the various trailers have have always grabbed my attention. It's out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010999/), [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6ffef56b-cf61-4e51-b729-b51fe5f828a9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZWFuaW1hbC85bjY3ZGhucDJtMHQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmZmVmNTZiLWNmNjEtNGU1MS1iNzI5LWI1MWZlNWY4MjhhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVhbmltYWwvOW42N2RobnAybTB0In0&signature=AQAAAdQl1sAR0LeEJjZmeMHwDNke_SFOu84RMUVzyK-QBqWM&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Freanimal%2F9n67dhnp2m0t) and [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/reanimal-switch-2/) for $40.

_Reanimal_ has single-player, couch co-op and online co-op modes. A friend pass that allows you to invite a pal to play with you online at no extra cost should be available soon.

[Mewgenics](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mewgenics-the-next-game-from-the-binding-of-isaacs-developer-will-arrive-next-february-on-pc-235740063.html) had been in the works for a very long time before it arrived this week. It was initially announced [in 2012](https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-16-latest-mew-genics-teaser-collects-trinkets-with-magic-propertie.html) when co-developer Edmund McMillen was still part of _Super Meat Boy_ studio Team Meat. After years of _Mewgenics_ being in development hell amid McMillen focusing on projects such as _The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth_, he's finally seen the game through with the help of longtime collaborator Tyler Glaiel.

This is a turn-based strategy roguelike in which players breed cats and then take kitties with wild mutations and blends of powers into combat. There's a lot to explore and discover here. McMillen and Glaiel claim the main campaign runs for over 200 hours. Having more than 10 character classes (each with 75 unique abilities), more than 900 items and hundreds of bosses and enemies could well ensure that things stay fresh enough to justify that run time.

Reviews have largely been positive for this one, though the humor didn't click for some critics. _Mewgenics_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/). It usually costs $30, but you can save $3 if you buy it by February 24.

_Rogue Point_ is a co-op shooter for up to four players that’s worth paying attention to, in large part because it’s from the team behind [_Black Mesa_](https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-black-mesa-the-fan-made-half-life-remake-finally-has-a-rel.html), the fan remake of _Half-Life_. It's now available in early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/), typically for $20, though there's a 15 percent discount until February 26.

This appears to be in the vein of tactical shooters like Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games. There are objective-based missions and a Counter-Strike-style economy for unlocking and upgrading gear. While there are only four maps as things stand, Crowbar Collective has implemented a system that randomizes the layouts to keep things fresh. 

## Upcoming 

Steam Next Fest is almost upon us. Many developers and publishers are preparing to release demos for their games, but some are arriving ahead of the event, such as one for _Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!_ The demo is a blast and it feels like the kind of retro _Starship Troopers_ shooter I wish we'd had in the late '90s. 

I really enjoy _Helldivers 2_, which takes a lot of inspiration from _Starship Troopers_. In turn, this game draws from _Helldivers 2_, with features like tossing a flare to tell a support craft to send gear down to the planet's surface. I just wish the mech was a bit more fun and effective to use.

If you would like to know more about this game from _Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun_ developer Auroch Digital and publisher Dotemu, you can check out the demo on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4307720/Starship_Troopers_Ultimate_Bug_War__Demo/). _Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!_ is coming to Steam, GOG, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 16.

A demo for a line-based puzzle title called _Rope_ popped up on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4329270/Rope_Demo/) this week ahead of the [full game's arrival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866170/Rope/) in April for about $3.50. The aim is to connect ropes of the same color to clear them. More rules will be introduced over time to make the game more challenging.

While _Rope_ looks charming enough, I mainly wanted to include it in this week’s roundup because I thought developer Ikuo's comments in the press release were quite lovely. 

"My games are neither flashy nor extravagant. Instead, I focus on preserving the essence of play. Like hide‑and‑seek or tag — simple rules that draw you in until you forget the time," Ikuo said. "_Rope_ brings that timeless spirit of play into a modern puzzle game. It is intuitive, endlessly replayable and quietly absorbing. I aimed to create a small, understated experience that stays with players long after they put it down. I hope this game leaves even a small impression on someone’s heart."

_The Mermaid Mask_ is a project that SFB Games put on the backburner after another one of their games became a hit (that would be [_Crow Country_](https://www.engadget.com/crow-country-is-a-darkly-meditative-callback-to-survival-horrors-past-130041405.html), which was one of our [favorite games of 2024](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2024-133005519.html)).

This point-and-click puzzle game is the latest installment in the long-running Detective Grimoire series_._ A teaser trailer doesn't give away too much, but I do enjoy what we see of the hand-drawn 2D animation here.

Here's hoping this is a worthy follow-up to _Tangle Tower_, an Apple Arcade game [we enjoyed very much](https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-apple-arcade-best-games.html). We'll find out for sure when _The Mermaid Mask_ lands on PC and consoles this summer. In the meantime, you can check out an updated demo that just hit [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/) ahead of Next Fest. 

The premise of _The Stairwell_ is practically identical to that of _The Exit 8_. You walk through a small, contained scene multiple times. If everything looks okay, keep walking forward. If something is out of the ordinary, you turn around. Just try not to miss many anomalies. Rather than walk through corridors as in _The Exit 8_ (the film adaptation of which [looks pretty promising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRQ1oatOt8)), _The Stairwell_ sees you going up or down a seemingly infinite tower as you try to reach the goal. 

This anomaly game, which is from Hidden Palace, has been on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3578120/The_Stairwell/) since last year. It’s coming to PS5 on February 19. Expect jump scares. 

Let's wrap things up for this week with an arcade game that requires just two inputs: one button to turn left, and another to veer right. You can't control the speed of your craft in _Ship v Maze_. All you can do to avoid crashing and ending your run is to react quickly enough to steer your ship through various obstacles. It's all about putting your reflexes to the test.

_Ship v Maze_ is from Cosmic Droplet (aka solo developer Frederic Vanmol), It'll hit [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113380/Ship_v_Maze/) on April 2 for $4. A demo is available now.
