Darth Maul, the beloved, sometimes spider-legged former Sith Lord first introduced in _Star Wars: Episode 1 — The Phantom Menace_, is officially getting his own animated spin-off on April 6, 2026, based on [a new teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oonACDq89BY) published by Disney. _Star Wars: Maul — Shadow Lord_ was [originally announced](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/darth-maul-animated-series-coming-to-disney-plus-1236194926/) at Star Wars Celebration in 2025, and is set after Maul's arc in _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ but before his appearance in _Star Wars: Rebels_.

The 10-episode series covers Maul's plot to rebuild his criminal syndicate "on a planet untouched by the Empire," [according to Lucasfilm](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-maul-shadow-lord-first-trailer-poster-art). "There, he crosses paths with a disillusioned young Jedi Padawan who may just be the apprentice he is seeking to aid him in his relentless pursuit for revenge." _Shadow Lord_ will premiere with two episodes on April 6, and will stream two episodes a week on Disney+ through May 6.

Like most of Disney's popular animated Star Wars shows, _Maul — Shadow Lord_ is created by Dave Filoni, a George Lucas supplicant, co-creator of _The Clone Wars_ and [newly minted](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/kathleen-kennedy-steps-down-as-lucasfilm-president-marking-a-new-era-for-the-star-wars-franchise-003407687.html) President and Chief Creative Officer at Luscafilm. Besides picking up the story threads he helped establish in his previous animated work, _Maul — Shadow Lord_ could be representative of the work that will define his tenure: stories that play in the pre-existing Star Wars sandbox.

Since completing their sequel trilogy in 2019 with _Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker_, Disney and Lucasfilm have struggled to define what the future of their franchise will actually be. New projects have [languished in pre-production](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/patty-jenkins-star-wars-1234851113/), interesting TV shows [have gotten cancelled](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-wars-the-acolyte-isnt-getting-a-second-season-120033350.html) and the only things that seem to come out with any consistency are spin-offs of _The Mandalorian_ and _The Clone Wars_. Disney and Lucasfilm will release [_The Mandalorian and Grogu_](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/disneys-mandalorian-and-grogu-trailer-shows-the-fall-of-a-lumbering-giant-141515618.html) on May 22, 2026, the first new Star Wars movie to hit theaters in seven years. The Shawn Levy-directed [_Star Wars: Starfighter_](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-goslings-star-wars-movie-is-titled-starfighter-and-will-be-released-in-2027-123049184.html), the first film set chronologically after the events of _Rise of Skywalker_, is slated to premiere on May 28, 2027.
