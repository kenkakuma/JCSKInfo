Those might not exactly be ads you're seeing on ChatGPT, at least according to OpenAI. Nick Turley, OpenAI's head of ChatGPT, clarified the confusion around potential ads appearing with the AI chatbot. In [a post on X](https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1997120491589349440?s=20), Turley said "there are no live tests for ads" and that "any screenshots you've seen are either not real or not ads." The OpenAI exec's explanation comes after [another post](https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/1996059933998285094) from former xAI employee Benjamin De Kraker on X that has gained traction, which featured a screenshot showing an option to shop at Target within a ChatGPT conversation.

OpenAI's [Daniel McAuley](https://x.com/_dmca/status/1996377763989877018) responded to the post, arguing that it's not an ad but rather an example of [app integration](https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/) that the company announced in October. However, the company's chief research officer, Mark Chen, also replied on X that they "fell short" in this case, adding that "anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care."

"We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision," Chen wrote on X. "We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful."

There's still a lot of uncertainty about whether OpenAI will introduce ads to ChatGPT, but in November, someone [discovered code](https://www.engadget.com/ai/code-suggests-that-openai-may-be-close-to-introducing-ads-for-chatgpt-172511090.html) in a beta version of the ChatGPT app on Android that made several mentions of ads. Even in Turley's post debunking the inclusion of live ads, the OpenAI exec added that "if we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach." Turley also posted that "people trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that."
