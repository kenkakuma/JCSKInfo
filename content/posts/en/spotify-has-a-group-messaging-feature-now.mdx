Spotify is adding group chats to the [messaging service](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-an-in-app-messaging-feature-134401088.html) it premiered last year. In [an addendum](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-08-26/introducing-messages-a-new-way-to-share-what-you-love-on-spotify-with-friends-and-family/) to the original blog post introducing Messages, the company announced that users can initiate chats with up to 10 of their friends to share the podcasts, playlists and songs they are listening to.

The [in-app messaging](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-an-in-app-messaging-feature-134401088.html) feature, which was released last August, works to keep users on the app instead of navigating to another platform to share content with friends. Since its introduction, Spotify has added functionality bit by bit. Earlier this month, the company added the ability to share what you're listening to [in real-time](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-now-lets-you-share-what-youre-listening-to-in-real-time-via-chat-173749120.html). Users can also invite chat participants to join a Jam, the app’s collaborative listening tool.

Spotify isn't the only content platform trying to make in-app messaging a thing. Late last year, YouTube said it would be [testing DMs](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-is-once-again-trying-to-make-dms-happen-205724221.html), after originally adding the feature in 2017 before removing it in 2019.
