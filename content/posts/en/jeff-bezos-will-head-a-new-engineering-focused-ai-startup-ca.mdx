Jeff Bezos is spearheading a new AI started called Project Prometheus, focused on his current interests in space and engineering, [_The_ _New York Times_ reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/bezos-project-prometheus.html). The company, which has yet to be made public, will reportedly have $6.2 billion in funding. Part of that sum will come from Bezos, who will act as co-CEO. 

Project Prometheus will reportedly focus on creating AI systems that gain knowledge from the physical world, rather than just processing digital information, like AI chatbots. In particular, the company will reportedly explore how AI can support engineering and manufacturing in areas such as vehicles and space technology. Bezos founded space technology company Blue Origin more than two decades ago. The company's [New Glenn rocket](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-safely-made-it-to-space-a-second-time-230324439.html) had a successful second flight last week. 

He is joined by Vik Bajaj as co-founder and co-CEO. Bajaj is a physicist and chemist who worked on projects at Google X including [Wing](https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-wing-shows-off-a-larger-delivery-drone-with-a-bigger-payload-capacity-163148392.html) and what became [Waymo](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-is-launching-in-three-new-cities-next-year-182515034.html). In 2018, he co-founded Foresite Labs, which supports entrepreneurs in the fields of AI and data science. Bajaj is still named as CEO of Foresite Labs on the company's website and [his LinkedIn page](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6f0d6f68-aa6c-4385-a7c2-f2b5161d6f3e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LinkedIn&linkText=his+LinkedIn+page&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vaW4vZHJ2aWtiYWphai8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmMGQ2ZjY4LWFhNmMtNDM4NS1hN2MyLWYyYjUxNjFkNmYzZSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2luL2RydmlrYmFqYWovIn0&signature=AQAAARUtd_mdRVyxbW2-aISuVepE5f82oGoJRw2c5y2h6Ck3&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdrvikbajaj%2F) — the latter of which also shows his new titles at Project Prometheus. Bajaj lists his involvement in the new company as starting this month and puts San Francisco, London and Zurich as its locations. 

On its [bare LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/project-prometheus25/about/), Project Prometheus' overview states only "AI for the physical economy." It also lists itself as a "Technology, Information and Internet" company with 51-200 employees. According to _The_ _New York Times_, Project Prometheus has hired nearly 100 people, with some employees coming from fellow AI companies like OpenAI and DeepMind.
