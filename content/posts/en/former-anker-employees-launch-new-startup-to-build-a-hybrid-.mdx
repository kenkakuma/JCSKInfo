A startup founded by former Anker employees plans to launch a hybrid RV next year. Evotrex "exists to transform how people experience the outdoors," according to CEO Alex Xiao. On Thursday, the California-based company [announced](https://www.evotrex.com/pages/evotrex-exits-stealth) that it had secured $16 million in Pre-A funding. Among its backers are Anker's founders (not Anker itself).

The RV trailer is designed to last for days far off the grid. To achieve that, its battery is supplemented by a gas engine. "Live rangelessly and focus on the adventure ahead instead of where to find the next charger," its website reads. Another line: "Relax off-grid without ever needing to leave your base camp." You get the picture: The idea is that the gas motor lets you venture farther from civilization for longer.

Evotrex's founders [told](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/anker-backed-hybrid-rv-startup-evotrex-comes-out-of-stealth/) _TechCrunch_ that the battery will power the RV’s cabin, electronics and electric motor. The gas motor is there to recharge the battery and extend its range. They claim that the gas engine is more eco-friendly than others. They say it's quieter and more efficient, and that the RV trailer can use the motor's excess heat to warm the cabin.

Evotrex is hardly alone in keeping gas engines around. EV sales have slowed, and the industry has responded in turn. According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/06/05/americans-interest-in-purchasing-electric-and-hybrid-vehicles/), 45 percent of Americans are likely to consider a hybrid vehicle. Only 33 percent said the same for an EV. So, we see automakers responding by [delaying EVs](https://www.engadget.com/ford-delays-some-electric-vehicles-renews-focus-on-hybrids-172007210.html) or [cutting production](https://www.engadget.com/ford-is-cutting-f-150-lightning-production-due-to-waning-demand-173838340.html). This week, Honda’s CEO said the Trump administration has put US EV growth back [by “five years or so.”](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/honda-shows-off-three-new-evs-in-tokyo-but-its-us-plans-are-getting-more-tepid-150000775.html) (Meanwhile, the UN warned this week that the world is [falling well short of crucial climate targets](https://www.engadget.com/science/un-emissions-report-the-planet-is-falling-well-short-of-its-climate-targets-184255639.html).)

Evotrex will fully reveal the RV trailer at CES 2026. The company will open reservations on January 6, and it plans to ship the first models by the end of next year. Apart from Anker's founders, investors include Unity Ventures, Kylinhall Partners, Vision Plus Capital and Xstar Capital. You can learn more at [the company’s website](https://www.evotrex.com).
