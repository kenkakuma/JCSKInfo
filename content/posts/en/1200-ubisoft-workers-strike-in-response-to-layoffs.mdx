At the end of last month, Ubisoft workers in the publisher’s native France [threatened](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html) to strike in the wake of sweeping layoffs and cost-cutting measures. This week, they made good on those threats. According to [_GamesIndustry.biz_](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring), union members confirmed that at least 1,200 staff participated in the three-day strike, which was due to run from February 10 to February 12.

While the strike action primarily took place in France, _GamesIndustry.biz_ was told that Ubisoft’s Milan office also took part. The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously [called](https://x.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1615263954955116546/photo/2) for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.

Some striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging. As well as [reportedly](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html) laying off hundreds of [employees](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html) already in 2026, Ubisoft also introduced a [mandate](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/dont-call-it-a-layoff-ubisoft-issues-a-full-return-to-office-order-for-all-employees-as-it-confirms-more-studio-closures-are-coming/) for its staff to return to work on site for five days a week. One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was [reportedly](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html) fired for doing so.

Ubisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too. The long-awaited _Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time_ remake was among six games [canceled](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html) by the struggling publisher last month, when it also confirmed several studio closures as part of the company’s organizational restructuring.

**Update, Feb. 12 2026, 12:39PM ET:** "We understand these changes, particularly those affecting work organization, are generating strong feelings," Ubisoft wrote in a statement shared with Engadget. "Since the announcement, we have held a series of discussions and information sessions at multiple levels to help teams better understand the new organization and to give them the opportunity to share their questions and concerns." The company added that it "remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives.”
