Meta has [long required](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-update-group-admins-flexibility-protecting-member-privacy/) Facebook users to post under their real names (with [some exceptions](https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-facebook-changes-real-name-policy-rules-after-public-outcry.html)), but at least for Facebook Groups, the company is now offering new options. Members of Facebook Groups will now be able to participate under a custom nickname and avatar, rather than being forced to use their real name or post anonymously.

You can set a custom nickname via the same toggle that lets you create an anonymous post, [Meta says](https://www.facebook.com/help/1997112804420300?helpref=faq_content). Nicknames have to be enabled by a group's administrators, and in some cases individually approved, but once they are, you can switch between posting under your real name or a nickname freely. The only other limitation is that the nickname needs to comply with Meta's existing Community Standards and Terms of Service. While you set your new nickname, you can also pick from a selection of custom avatars, which seem to mostly be pictures of cute animals wearing sunglasses.

Groups are one of several areas of Facebook that Meta has continually tried to tweak in the last few years to bring back users. In 2024, the company [introduced a tab](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-is-pushing-local-content-and-events-to-try-to-win-back-young-adults-161742961.html) that highlighted local events shared in Facebook groups. More recently, it [added tools](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-update-group-admins-flexibility-protecting-member-privacy/) for admins to convert private groups into public ones to try and draw in new members. No single change can make Facebook the center of young people's lives in the way it was in the early 2000s, but letting people use what amounts to a username might encourage Facebook users to explore new groups and post more freely.
