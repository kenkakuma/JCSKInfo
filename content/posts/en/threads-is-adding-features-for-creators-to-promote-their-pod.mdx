Threads is working on new features that could make the text-based social network a bit more audio-friendly. Starting today, Threads is rolling out some new [features](https://www.threads.com/@threads/post/DQ7OtMeEftX) for sharing podcasts and podcast episodes. Creators have the option to add the link to their show to their bio page; after that, their posts with show and episode links will appear with an audio preview. Non-hosts will also start to see the new previews when they post links to their favorite shows.  

For starters, the rollout is only supporting Spotify shows. Connor Hayes, who heads up Threads and also [posted](https://www.threads.com/@conno_r/post/DQ7PhZ0DzqI?xmt=AQF0JiqpJCC5OZoQLN040bsV0b-H1Yw6wMcQ4F86tm79eA) about the new feature, said in a reply to another user that Apple Podcasts will also eventually receive support. The previews are going live today and will become available to all users over the coming weeks.

In theory, this feature could help attract new listeners. However, Threads doesn't have a strong success rate when it comes to its [users clicking on links](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-users-still-barely-click-links-170139103.html). It should be interesting to see if the audiovisual addition makes it any more appealing for people to visit podcast pages.
