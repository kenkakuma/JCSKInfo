Color is the buzziest feature in ereaders right now, but is it necessary? It makes the covers more fun, and readers of comics and graphic novels will appreciate the added hues (though they may be happier with an [E Ink tablet](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html) for better image detail). Color is just one factor to consider when picking out the best ereader. The lights, screen quality, housing and buttons make a difference too. Then there’s the software: Do you want to stay in the Kindle ecosystem or get a device that can handle lots of apps? We tested more than a dozen ereaders to come up with our recommendations. This guide also points out ways to get the most out of your new e-book companion once you pick your favorite.

## Best ebook readers for 2026

## What to look for in an ereader

Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. 

Color ereaders add a [color filter array](https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido) on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.

Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.

The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write [E Ink tablets](https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html) like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.

### **Reading features**

With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.

As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.

Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. 

### **Other features**

The capabilities of these pocket libraries have [advanced](https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html) considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read _Crook Manifesto_.

If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.

Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even [Kindles](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html)) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.

## How to get books for your ereader

Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store.

Amazon offers [Kindle Unlimited](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Kindle+Unlimited&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2tpbmRsZS1kYnMvaHovc3Vic2NyaWJlL2t1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9raW5kbGUtZGJzL2h6L3N1YnNjcmliZS9rdSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAASmxWqo95kBNE8NLkxCzn7oxD5CPAqPFDcrCNGnfRa_k&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle-dbs%2Fhz%2Fsubscribe%2Fku) for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called [Kobo Plus](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Kobo&linkText=Kobo+Plus&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wbHVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvYm8uY29tL3VzL2VuL3BsdXMifQ&signature=AQAAAa7WgnchLKDvWTGft4BfkG4qJr8EiMMbJ6ARNaq91jTJ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fplus) with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both.

Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.

### **How to upload ePubs onto an ereader**

Stores like [ebooks.com](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f51e60ee-4f67-422e-a9c1-0b39bd990155&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=ebooks.com&linkText=ebooks.com&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYm9va3MuY29tL2VuLXVzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYm9va3MuY29tL2VuLXVzLyJ9&signature=AQAAAUXjnTOQ-yFSP4B4gvJ_0dXy11EG2GFMvSQbxc0FcrdY&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fen-us%2F) and [Google Play](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&linkText=Google+Play&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9ib29rcz9obD1lbl9VUyZnbD1VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9ib29rcz9obD1lbl9VUyZnbD1VUyJ9&signature=AQAAASZY0gT_fKMpYAx96_pPEUaXBkxUdcX2GsuN5W5Q3ANH&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fbooks%3Fhl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS) have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. 

Titles from some publishers like [Tor](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f51e60ee-4f67-422e-a9c1-0b39bd990155&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=ebooks.com&linkText=Tor&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYm9va3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3B1Ymxpc2hlci90b3ItcHVibGlzaGluZy1ncm91cC8yMDcwNDQxNTM_X2M9MSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lYm9va3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3B1Ymxpc2hlci90b3ItcHVibGlzaGluZy1ncm91cC8yMDcwNDQxNTM_X2M9MSJ9&signature=AQAAAQUyZwAAUpn1O8a3NEBjNZideb_useX_bNCXa9YRXyJb&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2Fen-us%2Fpublisher%2Ftor-publishing-group%2F207044153%3F_c%3D1) and public domain classics from sites like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader _do_ support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.

To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called [Adobe Digital Editions](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=73e6d253-5a10-4f58-b539-815233e32f36&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Adobe&linkText=Adobe+Digital+Editions&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAAZHqqiiAxW0zph0RbXm7OdiW_5kDVWfy8mgD2jdFYezz&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html) (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free [Adobe ID](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&linkText=Adobe+ID&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHB4LmFkb2JlLmNvbS9tYW5hZ2UtYWNjb3VudC91c2luZy9jcmVhdGUtdXBkYXRlLWFkb2JlLWlkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxweC5hZG9iZS5jb20vbWFuYWdlLWFjY291bnQvdXNpbmcvY3JlYXRlLXVwZGF0ZS1hZG9iZS1pZC5odG1sIn0&signature=AQAAAe1FmisAa8XGIvkkTl5PDnkcDwNZclFfu47-GV95Mtev&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fmanage-account%2Fusing%2Fcreate-update-adobe-id.html). Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.

Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the [Send to Kindle](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Send+to+Kindle&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NlbmR0b2tpbmRsZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc2VuZHRva2luZGxlIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&signature=AQAAAS5ZVsNxdCVtDYx5iNTxXHLeRX1mGBWg9NRQRPJNtX_j&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsendtokindle) page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.

Boox also uses a browser uploader called [BooxDrop](https://push.boox.com/#/push/file) (along with [many other methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk)) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.

Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and [up to 100 percent of the profits](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html) will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the [Bookshop.org app](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9db8d14c-9935-42a7-8088-54e01b60ae32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Bookshop&linkText=Bookshop.org+app&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vYm9va3Nob3Aub3JnLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vYm9va3Nob3Aub3JnLyJ9&signature=AQAAAVxd4CluVkpVSZt20v3DXVyWURt8UxcMVrQMGnBgx7G0&gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2F), but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders.

### **How to read library books on an ereader**

Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called [Overdrive](https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html) and its companion app [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby). On a [Kobo](https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader), you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs.

To read library books on a [Kindle](https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html), you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.

For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.

You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.

## How we test ereaders

When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.

Over the course of the past three years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far:

## Other ereaders we tested

### Amazon Kindle Colorsoft

[Amazon’s first color Kindle](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html) impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.

Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: "A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward."

Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing.

### **Boox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader**

Boox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome [Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II)](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&linkText=Go+7+and+a+color-screen+Go+Color+7+%28Gen+II%29&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZ283Izp-OnRleHQ9V2F0Y2glMjB0aGUlMjB2aWRlby0sVHdvJTIwRGlzcGxheXMsLSUyQyUyMFR3byUyMEtpbmRzJTIwb2YiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zaG9wLmJvb3guY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvNyM6fjp0ZXh0PVdhdGNoJTIwdGhlJTIwdmlkZW8tLFR3byUyMERpc3BsYXlzLC0lMkMlMjBUd28lMjBLaW5kcyUyMG9mIn0&signature=AQAAAXIxxfcPkPJsAEPeG0oasL5MvRqW6YMGj0xd6E0erdjb&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgo7%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DWatch%2520the%2520video-%2CTwo%2520Displays%2C-%252C%2520Two%2520Kinds%2520of). After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus.

I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be [better served by an E Ink tablet](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html), but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.

## Ereader FAQs

### **What's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?**

Really, they are the same thing. [E Ink](https://www.eink.com/about?company) is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.

But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink _tablets_. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to [helping you pick out an E Ink tablet](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html).

### **Are there ads on my ereader?**

The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads.

### **Which ereader has the longest battery life?**

Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.

### **Which ereaders can read Kindle books?**

Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.

### **Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?**

Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can _only_ be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.

### **What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?**

Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.

The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of [Kindle-only books](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Kindle-only+books&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011) is much larger [than Kobo’s](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Kobo&linkText=than+Kobo%E2%80%99s&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals).

### **Which ereader is best for library books?**

Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.
