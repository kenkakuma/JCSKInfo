Proton’s latest update for [Lumo](https://www.engadget.com/with-lumo-proton-thinks-it-can-carve-a-place-at-the-ai-table-130000740.html), its privacy-focused chatbot, introduces a feature called Projects. It’s a dedicated and encrypted space for tasks that you know you’ll access again and again over an extended period of time, such as papers you’ll have to work on the whole semester or plans for a big trip you’re taking later this year.

Lumo will remember and keep all the information and all the files you upload for every project you create. Any document you upload or resources you add to the chat will sync across devices, so you don’t have to repeat yourself every time you access a task. Projects are also integrated with Proton Drive, allowing you to easily link documents and other files in your chats.

Proton says you can use the feature for just about any topic you want and give the chatbot tailored instructions for every project you create. It also said that each project is its own encrypted environment and that it will not use your chat histories to train AI models. To be clear, Lumo uses open source AI models, including Nemo, OpenHands 32B, OLMO 2 32B and Mistral Small 3.

The latest version of Lumo is now available to all users, but you’re only limited to one project if you’re on a free account. To be able to created an unlimited number of projects, you’ll have to subscribe to Lumo Plus, which costs $10 a month.
