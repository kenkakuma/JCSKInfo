OpenAI may have called GPT-5.2 its "most advanced frontier model for professional work," but tests conducted by the [_Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/latest-chatgpt-model-uses-elon-musks-grokipedia-as-source-tests-reveal) cast doubt on its credibility. According to the report, OpenAI's GPT-5.2 model cited [Grokipedia](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-grokipedia-is-online-after-it-briefly-crashed-out-231108836.html), the online encyclopedia powered by xAI, when it came to specific, but controversial topics related to Iran or the Holocaust.

As seen in the _Guardian_'s report, ChatGPT used Grokipedia as a source for claims about the Iranian government being tied to telecommunications company MTN-Irancell and questions related to Richard Evans, a British historian who served as an expert witness during a libel trial for Holocaust denier David Irving. However, the _Guardian_ noted ChatGPT didn't use Grokipedia when it came to a prompt asking about media bias against Donald Trump and other controversial topics.

OpenAI released the [GPT-5.2 model](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html) in December to better perform at professional use, like creating spreadsheets or handling complex tasks. Grokipedia preceded GPT-5.2's release, but ran into some controversy when it was seen [including citations](https://www.engadget.com/ai/authorities-probe-holocaust-denial-responses-from-xs-grok-155835701.html) to neo-Nazi forums. A study done by US researchers also showed that the AI-generated encyclopedia [cited](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251114-musk-s-grokipedia-leans-on-questionable-sources-study-says) "questionable" and "problematic" sources.

In response to the _Guardian_ report, OpenAI told the outlet that its GPT-5.2 model searches the web for a "broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints," but applies "safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms."
