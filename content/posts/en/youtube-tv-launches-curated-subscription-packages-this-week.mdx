YouTube is launching [YouTube TV Plans this week](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-plans-launch-pricing/), after revealing the program [back in December](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-plans-will-let-you-choose-genre-specific-content-packages-182909455.html). These are genre-specific subscription packages that let users opt into a curated version of the service and save a few bucks in the process. Yeah. It's pretty much cable, proving you can't cut a cord if it's made out of invisible radio waves.

There more than ten plans available and they are all cheaper than the [typical asking price of $83 per month](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html). There's a Sports Plan that costs $65 per month and includes channels like FS1, NBC Sports Network and all of the ESPN networks. Subscribers will pay $72 per month to add some news channels like CNN and CSPAN to the sports package.

The Entertainment Plan costs $55 per month and includes networks like Bravo, Comedy Central, FX and the Food Network, among many others. There's a beefier version of this that costs $70 per month and adds in family channels like the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, along with news channels.

Signing up for one of these plans still provides various perks of a standard YouTube TV subscription. These include unlimited DVR, multiview and the ability to add up to six members on one account. Of course, those with deep pockets can spring for some premium add-ons like HBO Max, 4K Plus and the NFL Sunday Ticket.

Some plans are rolling out later in the week, but YouTube says it could take "several weeks" for every plan to become available. New customers receive a discount for the first three months, which is worth looking into.
