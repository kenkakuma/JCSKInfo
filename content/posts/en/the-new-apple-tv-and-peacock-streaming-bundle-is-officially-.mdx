There's yet another streaming bundle in town, and it will be ideal for fans of _Ted Lasso_ and _The Office_. Apple and NBC have [teamed up](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=e57ba9f0-f4a8-43cb-94e6-d49b44d47b7f&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Apple&linkText=teamed+up&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8xMC9hcHBsZS1hbmQtbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsLWludHJvZHVjZS10aGUtYXBwbGUtdHYtYW5kLXBlYWNvY2stYnVuZGxlLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTU3YmE5ZjAtZjRhOC00M2NiLTk0ZTYtZDQ5YjQ0ZDQ3YjdmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8xMC9hcHBsZS1hbmQtbmJjdW5pdmVyc2FsLWludHJvZHVjZS10aGUtYXBwbGUtdHYtYW5kLXBlYWNvY2stYnVuZGxlLyJ9&signature=AQAAAa562fukMVKHgz3hUiCVzKDjBHkR_LgHBfRkCnLC352q&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F10%2Fapple-and-nbcuniversal-introduce-the-apple-tv-and-peacock-bundle%2F) to provide both of their streaming services together in a bundle starting at $15 per month. The new [Apple TV + Peacock bundle](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=e57ba9f0-f4a8-43cb-94e6-d49b44d47b7f&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Peacock+TV&linkText=Apple+TV+%2B+Peacock+bundle&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyNpYi1zZWN0aW9uLXNlY3Rpb24tMTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1N2JhOWYwLWY0YTgtNDNjYi05NGU2LWQ0OWI0NGQ0N2I3ZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVhY29ja3R2LmNvbS8jaWItc2VjdGlvbi1zZWN0aW9uLTEwIn0&signature=AQAAAesZe5Xq8OoZLXRCYM_O4KKtFkCmGRCu1XMzSJYZsk3-&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F%23ib-section-section-10) is officially available now for $15 monthly for the ad-supported tier.

This is a mighty fine deal, given that Apple TV recently changed both its [name](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-is-now-just-apple-tv-200644609.html) and [price](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-tv-subscriptions-just-rose-to-13-a-month-150516370.html). The platform costs $13 per month now on its own. Peacock starts at $11 per month. In other words, this is a discount of around $9 each month. In this economy, we'll take any savings we can get.

As mentioned previously, the only caveat is that the base tier includes ads. The subscription shoots up to $20 per month for an ad-free version. However, a standalone subscription to ad-free Peacock is $17 on its own. Additionally, Apple One subscribers will get a 35 percent discount on Peacock Premium Plus plans. It's always nice when two lonely corporations find friendship, isn't it?

For the uninitiated, Apple TV is the company's big-wig streaming platform. It's primarily known for sci-fi like _Severance_, _For All Mankind_ and the upcoming _Pluribus_. The platform is also host to plenty of comedy, like _The Studio_, _Shrinking_ and _Ted Lasso_.

Peacock is NBC's streaming service. It streams old-school network programming like _The Office_, _Grimm_ and _Superstore_. The service features a stable of original programming like _Poker Face_, _Twisted Metal_ and the [underrated _Mrs. Davis_](https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html). The platform also recently premiered a little show called _The Paper_, which is a spinoff of _The Office_. Against all odds, this is actually a great little sitcom and a worthy successor to the original.
