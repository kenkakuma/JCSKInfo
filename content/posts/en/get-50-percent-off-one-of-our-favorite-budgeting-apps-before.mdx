Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a [budgeting app](https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html). There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. [Monarch Money](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Monarch+Money&linkText=Monarch+Money&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNobW9uZXkuY29tLyJ9&signature=AQAAAT0Ut7Nem4rsZGbkFVAwL4KNEnrEGyd3WNDQRuV2G2lr&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarchmoney.com%2F) is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code **MONARCHVIP** at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50.

As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app.

We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it [offers a great deal of customization and granularity](https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html), which outweighs our misgivings.

On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time.

Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth.

If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a [Mint replacement](https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html). But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, [Quicken Simplifi](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=36291888-36d6-4b83-80bb-f82004bcfdb1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=07209026-3487-417e-9b66-aaab79027199&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Quicken&linkText=Quicken+Simplifi&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWlja2VuLmNvbS9scC9wcGMvYnJhbmQtc2ltcGxpZmkvPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMDkwMjYtMzQ4Ny00MTdlLTliNjYtYWFhYjc5MDI3MTk5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5xdWlja2VuLmNvbS9scC9wcGMvYnJhbmQtc2ltcGxpZmkvPyJ9&signature=AQAAAemSk1v1MGvwTKyptC82fH30B4CswSlvf-IZHkwzUvnm&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quicken.com%2Flp%2Fppc%2Fbrand-simplifi%2F%3F), also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.
