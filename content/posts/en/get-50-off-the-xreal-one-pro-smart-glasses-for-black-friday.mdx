Some Xreal smart glasses have been discounted as part of a Black Friday promotion. This includes the recently-released Xreal One Pro glasses. The smart specs [are down to $600](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0FDPNC49S&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ceac0418-a64d-4a6c-bc53-d3e89f22267d&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=are+down+to+%24600&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1hSRUFMLUdsYXNzZXMtWC1QcmlzbS1EaXNwbGF5LUFuZHJvaWQvZHAvQjBGRFBOQzQ5Uy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2VhYzA0MTgtYTY0ZC00YTZjLWJjNTMtZDNlODlmMjIyNjdkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1hSRUFMLUdsYXNzZXMtWC1QcmlzbS1EaXNwbGF5LUFuZHJvaWQvZHAvQjBGRFBOQzQ5Uy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAfKr-5_HHaqSFYstmjrOfQXQiqwoxhC19IFxWSGdWqV3&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXREAL-Glasses-X-Prism-Display-Android%2Fdp%2FB0FDPNC49S%2F), which is $50 off. The sale applies to both sizes.

These glasses [are the real deal](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xreals-new-one-pro-ar-glasses-are-surprisingly-good-143034826.html). We praised them [in our official review](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/xreals-one-pro-intrigues-me-in-ways-metas-smart-glasses-dont-120000554.html), saying they offer similar functionality to the Apple Vision Pro, but at a much friendlier price point. Wearing these glasses allows access to a massive 222-inch virtual display that can be used for just about anything. The glasses connect to laptops, gaming consoles and smartphones, among other gadgets.

The 1080p Micro-OLED screens are surprisingly bright and sharp, which makes this device great for both work and consuming content. The frames even darken to give the illusion of wearing sunglasses.

The glasses are light and comfortable, especially when compared to the Vision Pro. However, the comfort does come at a price. These oversized glasses are not as immersive as Apple's product, because they don't completely block out light and cover the entire face. They offer a 57-degree field of view. This is squarely an augmented reality product and not a virtual reality product.

The company has also discounted its [Xreal One AR glasses to $400](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0F7R96TFC&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ceac0418-a64d-4a6c-bc53-d3e89f22267d&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Xreal+One+AR+glasses+to+%24400&custData=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&signature=AQAAAfTxxkRs4V656cgcK7-1gM-ne4RW9O8K9UKhGbYl1GBT&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXREAL-Glasses-Display-Expertly-Android%2Fdp%2FB0F7R96TFC%2F), which is a discount of around $100. These offer smaller virtual screens than the Pro, with a 50-degree field of view.
