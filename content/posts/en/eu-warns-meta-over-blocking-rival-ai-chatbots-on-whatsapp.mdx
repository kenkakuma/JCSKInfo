The EU could take "interim measures" against WhatsApp as it investigates AI providers' access to the app. On Monday, the [EU's regulatory arm announced](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_310) its "preliminary view" that Meta, WhatsApp's parent company, violated antitrust laws by blocking third-party AI assistants from operating on WhatsApp. 

The European Commission's is concerned that [Meta's actions](https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-says-it-wont-sign-the-eus-ai-code-of-practice-190132690.html) will limit competitors from entering the AI assistant market. "We must protect effective competition in this vibrant field, which means we cannot allow dominant tech companies to illegally leverage their dominance to give themselves an unfair advantage," Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition said in a statement. 

Ribera continued: "AI markets are developing at rapid pace, so we also need to be swift in our action. That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp while the investigation is ongoing, and avoid Meta’s new policy irreparably harming competition in Europe." 

The issue arose in October when Meta announced updates to its WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. According to the European Commission, the January 15 update would "effectively" make [Meta AI](https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-is-coming-to-europe-this-week-113019014.html) the only AI assistant available on WhatsApp. The regulatory agency [opened an investigation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896) into the matter on December 4. 

Today's update stands as a warning to Meta that the European Commission initially believes the company has violated antitrust regulation. A final decision is still to come. It also gave Meta a chance to respond to the allegations — which it swiftly did. 

"The facts are ‍that there is no reason for the EU to ​intervene in the WhatsApp ‌Business API," a Meta spokesperson [told _Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-criticises-eu-antitrust-move-against-whatsapp-block-ai-rivals-2026-02-09/). "There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating ⁠systems, devices, websites, ​and industry ​partnerships."
