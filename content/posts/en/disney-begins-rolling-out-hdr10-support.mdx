Disney+ is making its first foray into HDR10+ content, but access to this content will be limited at the start. About 1,000 shows from Hulu will be available with this HDR standard, although other programming under the Disney umbrella will add support at an unspecified later date. Samsung, which is a major player behind this standard for high dynamic range video, [announced](https://news.samsung.com/us/hdr10-supported-content-on-disney-launches-first-on-samsung-tvs/) the news. Disney+ will first offer the HDR10+ content on Samsung Crystal UHD TVs and above for models dating back to 2018, as well as select on Samsung Smart Monitors. 

HDR10+ builds on the HDR10 tech for image quality. It's an alternative to Dolby Vision, and both [technologies](https://www.engadget.com/hdr10-dolby-vision-hlg-does-071610283.html) offer viewers a wider range of contrast, brightness and colors on a scene-by-scene basis. (Assuming you have a screen that supports it, of course.) 

Netflix [announced](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-will-stream-shows-and-movies-in-hdr10-on-supported-devices-222134243.html) the addition of HDR10+ support in March, but [a handful of platforms](https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-new-roku-devices-hdr-10-054505875.html) have supported the standard for much longer.
