Fresh off a reorganized deal with OpenAI, Microsoft is diversifying its AI investments. The company [says](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=05ec7ebe-fb83-493b-8013-b8770e42eae9&featureId=text-link&linkText=says&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Jsb2dzLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDI1LzExLzE4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1udmlkaWEtYW5kLWFudGhyb3BpYy1hbm5vdW5jZS1zdHJhdGVnaWMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXBzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDVlYzdlYmUtZmI4My00OTNiLTgwMTMtYjg3NzBlNDJlYWU5Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Jsb2dzLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDI1LzExLzE4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1udmlkaWEtYW5kLWFudGhyb3BpYy1hbm5vdW5jZS1zdHJhdGVnaWMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXBzLyJ9&signature=AQAAAS673pEdkU8B_oW5Qj68F2GuxNL_UABq_9qmUjFf1UxO&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fblog%2F2025%2F11%2F18%2Fmicrosoft-nvidia-and-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships%2F) it will invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic. Meanwhile, NVIDIA has pledged up to $5 billion in the Claude maker. The three-way partnership, which includes various other commitments, could be seen as further evidence that an AI bubble is about to burst.

As part of the deal, Anthropic has committed to buy $30 billion of Microsoft Azure cloud computing capacity. Anthropic says it will also contract additional capacity, up to one gigawatt. In addition, Microsoft Foundry customers will gain access to several Claud models. These include [Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1](https://www.engadget.com/claude-sonnet-45-is-anthropics-safest-ai-model-yet-170000161.html) and Haiku 4.5.

Meanwhile, NVIDIA and Anthropic will work together to improve Anthropic's AI models for NVIDIA hardware. The pair will also optimize future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic's needs.

All of this is against the backdrop of Microsoft's recently [renewed partnership with OpenAI](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-completes-corporate-reorganization-with-support-from-microsoft-133109385.html), which loosens their exclusivity. It didn’t take long to see the apparent fruit of that. Early this month, the ChatGPT maker [signed a $38 billion cloud contract with Amazon](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-38-billion-cloud-contract-with-amazon-151821384.html). And last week, Anthropic said it will use AWS AI chips after [Amazon invested an additional $4 billion](https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-will-use-aws-ai-chips-after-4-billion-amazon-investment-222053145.html) in the Claude maker.

The two Spider-Men meme: two versions of the web-slinger, pointing at each other.

Marvel.com

Dizzy yet? To borrow imagery from the "two Spider-Men" meme, the AI world increasingly looks like a big circle of web-slingers, all pointing at each other. Only in this case, each index finger is flinging billions of dollars to help prop up the other Spider-Men. (Pay no mind to the [AI layoffs](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html).) It's too early to say how this all plays out, but the circular nature here makes it easier to understand why [some believe we're looking at a bubble](https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html). NVIDIA's earnings tomorrow could tell us more.
