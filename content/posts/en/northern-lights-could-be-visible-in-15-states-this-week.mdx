US residents across 15 states could be in for a show tonight and throughout the week. Incoming coronal mass ejections may spark geomagnetic storms that blaze up the northern lights for all to see, [according to a report by](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g1-watch-valid-10-nov-and-g2-watch-valid-11-12-nov) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Forecasters anticipate geomagnetic activity and aurora displays from November 10 until November 12 in states such as New York, Minnesota, Iowa and Alaska, among others. This is due to a trio of coronal mass ejections that began on November 7.

NOAA

As previously stated, the latest NOAA aurora forecast map notes that 15 US states are fully or partially above the view line. This isn't an exact science, as it's entirely possible that those living below the view line could get a glimpse of something in the night sky. Auroras are fickle, so it's also possible that the lightshow will be understated. A number of conditions have to align for the perfect display.

If you're planning on heading out tonight for a look, here are some tips. Make sure to find a north-facing vantage point with a clear view of the horizon. You want to be as far from light pollution as possible, so head away from large cities. Use a mobile phone to scan the skies as the camera is actually better at picking up faint lights before being visible to the naked eye. This can help pinpoint where to focus attention.

The last truly powerful and widespread aurora event in the US [took place last year](https://www.engadget.com/extreme-geomagnetic-storm-may-bless-us-with-more-aurora-displays-tonight-and-tomorrow-192033210.html). That geomagnetic storm was one of the strongest in the past two decades. It's unlikely this week's activity will be quite as striking.
