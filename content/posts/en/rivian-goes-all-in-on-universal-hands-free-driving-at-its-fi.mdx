EV automaker Rivian just held its [inaugural Autonomy and AI day](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-autonomy-and-ai-day-live-updates-from-the-ev-makers-inaugural-event-150031089.html) which, unsurprisingly, focused extensively on hands-free driving. An upcoming software update promises the introduction of "universal hands-free" driving. The company says its vehicles will be able to autonomously navigate more than 3.5 million miles of roads in North America, "covering the vast majority of marked roads in the US."

This is coming to the [R2 line of EVs](https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reveals-the-45000-r2-electric-suv-and-its-siblings-the-r3-and-r3x-185640727.html), but also Gen 2 R1 vehicles like the [recently-released Rivian R1S](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-r1s-gen-2-review-the-rugged-foundation-of-rivians-electric-empire-120021072.html). The service will be locked behind a subscription for something called Autonomy+ that includes self-driving, but also offers access to forthcoming and unannounced autonomous features. Rivian customers can pay $2,500 for lifetime access to the platform or $50 per month.

The R2 is getting LiDAR sensors, which will presumably help enable some of those upcoming autonomous features, in addition to a new chip called the Rivian Autonomy Processor. The processor has been designed for multimodal applications and runs the company's proprietary neural net engine. Both of these features are expected "to ship on R2 models starting at the end of 2026."

Today's event wasn't just about hands-free driving. Many of the company's vehicles will soon be given access to the AI-powered Rivian Assistant, which uses LLMs and [can connect to apps](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/rivian-adds-google-maps-features-to-its-navigation-app-140033783.html) like Google Calendar. This assistant will be model-agnostic, as it will "orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task."

In addition to the upcoming R2, the company is prepping the R3 and R3X. A Rivian offshoot just introduced an extremely expensive, but modular, [electric bike called the TM-B](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/rivian-spinoff-reveals-a-3500-starting-price-for-its-first-e-bike-195949124.html).
