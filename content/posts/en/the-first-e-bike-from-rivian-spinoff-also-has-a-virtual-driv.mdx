Ever since Rivian spun off its "micromobility business" into a [standalone startup](https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-spins-out-micromobility-business-into-new-startup-also-inc) called Also earlier this year, there's been much speculation about what kind of vehicles the company is working on. Now, Also is showing off its first products: a lineup of e-bikes and two pedal-assisted electric quads. 

The TM-B e-bike is Also's attempt at a do-it-all e-bike that can adapt to different use cases whether that's daily commuting, trail riding or kid and cargo-hauling. It sports a modular frame that can also accommodate a bench seat or rear cargo rack that supports up to 35KG of weight. It only comes in one frame size, but Also says it should be able to adapt to "multiple body sizes." 

The removable USB-C battery comes in two sizes: standard, which can power up to 60 miles of riding, and large, which maxes out at 100 miles of range. In terms of power, the TM-B’s throttletops out at 20MPH. Also is taking an interesting approach to its drive system, with a setup it's labeled "DreamRide." Instead of a mechanical connection between the bike's rear wheel and the pedals, the TM-B uses "software-defined pedaling," which will make the riding experience more customizable, according to Also.

Given the bike's roots at Rivian, it's not surprising that there are also a bunch of other tech-enabled features, including a 5-inch touchscreen display, called "Portal," that supports navigation, music playback and calling features via an accompanying app. There’s also a built-in security system that automatically locks the frame and rear wheel when you walk away.

Also is selling the TM-B in three configurations. The first to ship next spring will be the $4,500 TM-B Limited Launch Edition, which has a range up to 100 miles, support for standard and sport ride modes and features transparent purple accents. The $4,500 TM-B Performance has the same features as the limited edition model, but has a slightly different color scheme, and will be available within the "first half" of 2026. Finally, there's a base-level TM-B model with a range of up to 60 miles that only comes with standard ride modes. Also hasn't announced an exact price, but says it will cost less than $4,000 when it ships "later in 2026." Pre-orders for the Launch Edition are [open now](https://ridealso.com/) and the other two bikes are available to reserve with a $50 deposit. The bikes will also be on display in Rivian showrooms later this year,

The company also previewed two electric, pedal-assisted quads it's calling TM-Q. The smaller quad is apparently meant for "families and individuals seeking a safe, compact alternative to cars" that can still haul “significant loads.” The larger TM-Q, on the other hand, is meant for commercial deliveries. Also has partnered with Amazon to develop fleets of such vehicles that can be used by delivery drivers. Both quads are intended to be used in bike lanes, according to Also. 

The company didn't share details about when these vehicles might be available or how much they'll cost.
