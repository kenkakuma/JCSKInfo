Id Software, the company behind Doom, has voted in favor of forming a "wall-to-wall" union. The term "wall-to-wall" refers to a union that includes every employee, regardless of duties. The vote wasn't unanimous, though a majority did vote in favor of the union.

The union will work in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which is the same organization involved with [parent company ZeniMax's recent unionization efforts](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/zenimax-and-microsoft-ratify-union-agreement-224148192.html). Microsoft, who owns ZeniMax, has already recognized this new effort, [according to a statement by the CWA](https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa). It [agreed to a labor neutrality agreement](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-and-cwa-forge-labor-neutrality-agreement-covering-all-zenimax-workers-212643324.html) with the CWA and ZeniMax workers last year, paving the way for this sort of thing.

"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," id Software producer and CWA committee member Andrew Willis wrote in a statement to Engadget.

From the onset, this union will look to protect remote work for id Software employees. "Remote work isn’t a perk. It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being,” said id Software Lead Services Programmer Chris Hays. He also said he looks forward to getting worker protections regarding the "responsible use of AI."

Workers at id began organizing around 18 months ago, [according to a report by _Aftermath_](https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/). Things sped up after Microsoft [closed several Bethesda studios](https://www.engadget.com/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-have-been-shut-down-183913558.html) in the middle of last year.

"We look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity and dedication these workers bring to every project," said CWA Local 6215 President Ron Swaggerty.

The developer's latest game is _Doom: The Dark Ages_, [which we loved](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/doom-the-dark-ages-review-goodbye-parkour-hello-shield-saw-140014377.html). It scooped up an award for accessibility at last night's [The Game Awards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html).
