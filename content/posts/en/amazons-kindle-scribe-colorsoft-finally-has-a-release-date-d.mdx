When it [announced the latest series of Kindle Scribe writing tablets in October](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-adds-the-kindle-scribe-colorsoft-and-scribe-3-to-its-writing-tablet-lineup-145031938.html), Amazon didn’t have a specific release date to share beyond “later this year.” And now that we’re approaching the final weeks of 2025, the company is meeting its own deadline by sharing that it will be available on December 10. That detail is now posted on [the Amazon product page for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DWRBVDN6&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=56ec9faa-33e5-42e2-9944-031d11b2d235&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=the+Amazon+product+page+for+the+Kindle+Scribe+Colorsoft&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFdSQlZETjY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTZlYzlmYWEtMzNlNS00MmUyLTk5NDQtMDMxZDExYjJkMjM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFdSQlZETjYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAVwrZfWO3jGHFq5_ndSKcKw6d0gYfCS2a7n-TEDbGFtF&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DWRBVDN6), if you’d like to see the date for yourself.

As a refresher, this is the third generation of the Kindle Scribe line of E Ink writing tablets. This year was the first time Amazon made three different versions of the Scribe, turning it into a series of products. At the entry-level, the Scribe without a front light will start at $430, while the model with a front light starts at $480. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which, as it name suggests, can render colors, will start at $630.

All three flavors will feature the updated hardware and design that’s a bit more symmetrical than previous generations, which had a thicker bezel on one side. They’re also thinner than older Scribes and come with redesigned Kindle software that can help make note-taking a bit more efficient. Based on my [hands-on with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-hands-on-vivid-and-responsive-145147981.html), it also seemed to render colors more vividly than competing devices like [the reMarkable Paper Pro](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html), though I’ll definitely need to get a review unit in for better comparison.

For now, check out our hands on of the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and review of the reMarkable Paper Pro and even [of the last-gen Kindle Scribe](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-2-review-in-progress-is-slightly-useful-ai-worth-the-extra-cash-140018638.html) to see if this is something you might want. While December 10 is cutting it pretty close to [the holiday gifting season](https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-best-tech-gifts-and-cool-gadgets-for-2025-140052697.html), it’s still weeks ahead of Christmas, so it might still be worth keeping an eye on.
