Hot on the heels of [AGDQ](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-awesome-games-done-quick-2026-174938687.html) in January, Games Done Quick is hosting its second speedrunning event of the year, Back to Black 2026, starting tomorrow, February 5. The four-day event is organized by [Black in a Flash](https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash) and is raising money for [Race Forward](https://www.raceforward.org/), a nonprofit that works across communities to address systemic racism.

Back to Black is timed to the start of Black History Month and highlights the deep bench of talent in the Black speedrunning community. A few runs, like ones for [_Hades II_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html#:~:text=Holt%2C%20Contributing%20Reporter-,Hades%202,-The%20first%20thing), _Donkey Kong Country_ and _Silent Hill 4_, were teased when Back to Black 2026 [was announced last year](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/games-done-quicks-back-to-black-event-returns-in-february-201500830.html). The [full schedule](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/63) has plenty of other runs worth checking out, though, like a co-op run through [_Plants vs Zombies: Replanted_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/plants-vs-zombies-is-getting-an-hd-remaster-with-co-op-155622843.html) on February 5 or an Any% run of _The Barbie Diaries: High School Mystery_ on February 6.  

Back to Black 2026 will be live on Games Done Quick's [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@gamesdonequick) channels from Thursday, February 5 through Sunday February 8.
