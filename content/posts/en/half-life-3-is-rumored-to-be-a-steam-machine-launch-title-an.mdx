[Half-Life fans](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html) are nothing if not patient. For the diehard fans out there, the latest test of patience comes from _Insider Gaming Weekly_'s [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA), which claimed that the third installment in the Half-Life franchise is set to release with the launch of the [Steam Machine](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html) sometime in spring 2026.

"The window I was specifically told was spring 2026 for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, for Half-Life 3," Mike Straw, one of the hosts of the _Insider Gaming Weekly_ podcast and senior editor at _Insider Gaming_, said. "At the end of the day, the game is real."

Straw added that all the previous dates for an announcement of the next Half-Life game have passed, but that his sources "are still adamant this is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine." However, being tied to Valve's latest hardware release could be an issue since Straw noted that the explosive jump in [RAM pricing](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html) is causing considerable concern for the Steam Machine's pricing announcement.

"There is a concern, however, they haven't made a decision on price, which is kind of holding back the announcement of anything else," Straw said. "There's no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what's going on on the component side."

While optimistic devotees were hoping for some teasers during [The Game Awards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html), Valve hasn't officially said anything. However, there's still a lot of hope, especially considering Valve updated _Half-Life 2_ for its [20th anniversary](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-celebrates-half-life-2s-20th-anniversary-with-a-big-update-174316547.html), and [previous rumors](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html) hinted at a game that's still in development but is playable from beginning to end.
