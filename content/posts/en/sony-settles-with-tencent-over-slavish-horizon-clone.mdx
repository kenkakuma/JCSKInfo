Earlier this year Sony [sued Tencent](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html) for copyright infringement over its _Light of Motiram_ game, calling it a "slavish clone" of Horizon Zero Dawn. Then, earlier this month, Tencent agreed to [stop promoting](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sony-sues-tencent-over-its-horizon-zero-dawn-clone-191009077.html) and publicly testing the game. Now, the two companies have reached a "confidential settlement" and the case has been dismissed, according to [court documents](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/) seen by [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement). _Light of Motiram_ has also disappeared from Steam and Epic's game stores. 

"SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter," Tencent's spokesperson told _The Verge._ 

When Sony first filed its lawsuit in July 2025, it said that Tencent's game appeared to copy aspects of not just _Horizon Zero Dawn_, but other franchise games including [_Horizon Forbidden West_](https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html) and [_Lego Horizon Adventures_](https://www.engadget.com/lego-horizon-adventures-might-be-sonys-most-important-game-of-the-year-160026354.html). That included the post-apocalyptic setting with humans and machines coexisting, the visual appearance of characters and even the marketing materials — something Engadget certainly noticed when Tencent first announced the game.
