To further push the limits of [consumerism](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-agentic-ai-checkout-to-shopping-140000930.html), Google has launched a new open standard for agentic commerce that's called [Universal Commerce Protocol](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/) (UCP). In brief, it's a framework that combines the power of AI agents and online shopping platforms to help customers buy more things.

Thanks to the introduction of UCP, Google is offering three new online shopping features. To start, Google's [AI mode](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-ai-mode-is-expanding-to-180-countries-and-adding-an-agentic-restaurant-finder-154833417.html) will have a new checkout feature that allows customers to buy eligible products from certain US retailers within Google Search. Currently, this feature works with Google Pay, but it will soon add PayPal compatibility and incorporate more capabilities, like related product discovery and using loyalty points.

On the merchant side, the UCP also established the Business Agent feature, which Google said will be "a virtual sales associate that can answer product questions in a brand’s voice." The Business Agent will launch tomorrow with early adopters including Lowe’s, Michaels, Poshmark, Reebok and more. Also for retailers, the UCP is responsible for the new Direct Offers feature, which lets companies advertising with Google to "present exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to buy, directly in AI Mode." The Direct Offers feature will work in tandem with the [ads in AI Mode](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-starts-testing-ads-in-ai-mode-192800265.html) that Google is testing.  

With UCP, Google Search, retailers and payment processors are joining forces to make online shopping even easier, whether it's figuring out what product to buy, completing the purchase or offering "post-purchase support." According to Google, UCP is compatible with existing industry protocols, like Agent2Agent, Agent Payment Protocols and Model Context Protocol. UCP was even co-developed with industry giants like Shopify, Etsy and Walmart, and was endorsed by even more companies in the commerce ecosystem, including Macy's, Stripe, Visa and more.
