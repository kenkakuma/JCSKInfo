We could be witnessing the start of the renaissance for [real buttons in cars](https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-drivers-want-more-physical-buttons-instead-of-touch-controls-044931087.html), courtesy of Volkswagen's [ID. Polo](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-unveils-a-new-cockpit-generation-debuting-with-the-all-new-id-polo-20056). The German automaker unveiled the interior of its upcoming compact EV, which features real buttons, switches and even a knob for audio controls.

"We have created an interior that feels like a friend from the very first contact," Volkswagen's chief designer, Andreas Mindt, said in a press release. "Clear physical buttons provide stability and trust, warm materials make it appealing, and charming details such as the new retro views of the instruments show the typical Volkswagen wink."

Volkswagen

Last year, Mindt told [_Autocar_](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions) that Volkswagen would commit to reintroducing physical buttons for the most important functions "in every car we make from now on," starting with the [ID. 2all concept car](https://www.engadget.com/vws-id2all-compact-ev-will-cost-under-25000-when-it-arrives-in-2025-194635462.html) that has since evolved to become the ID. Polo. The EV maker backed up those claims since the ID. Polo will feature tangible buttons underneath the infotainment display, along with a steering wheel that's packed with even more clear buttons. Between the driver and passenger, Volkswagen even included a knob that can adjust audio volume or shuffle between tracks and radio stations.

Volkswagen

Besides the renewed emphasis on physical controls, Volkswagen still included a 10.25-inch digital cockpit behind the steering wheel. In the center, there's a nearly 13-inch touchscreen that serves as the infotainment system. For a retro throwback, the ID. Polo can swap its cockpit display to one that's inspired by the classic Golf I from the 1980s through a button on its steering wheel or with the infotainment touchscreen.

The ID. Polo is expected to be the first of [four new EVs](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-previews-its-%e2%82%ac20000-ev-for-everyone-211053623.html) in Volkswagen's small and compact car segment, which will see releases in European markets starting this year. However, it's not all good news, since Volkswagen has no plans to release the compact EV in the US.
