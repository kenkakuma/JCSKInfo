At $68, that's a savings of 14 percent for one of Apple's best accessories from a company that does not often run sales.

The multi-touch mouse was [first released](https://www.engadget.com/2009-11-03-hands-on-with-the-magic-mouse.html) in 2009 with a modest refresh [released in 2015](https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/25/review-apples-magic-trackpad-2-and-magic-mouse-2-open-new-doors-for-mac) and the addition of a USB-C port in 2024. The rechargeable mouse features gesture controls and automatically pairs with your Mac when connected via USB. The Magic Mouse can also be used with an iPad via Bluetooth, or with a Windows PC, though in that case, functionality would be limited.

Famously, Jony Ive's design of the Magic Mouse sees its charge port on the underside of the body, rendering it unusable while charging. In 2024 there were [rumors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apples-magic-mouse-may-be-getting-a-big-makeover-in-the-next-year-or-so-174255032.html) of a more comprehensive redesign coming but nothing has materialized since.
