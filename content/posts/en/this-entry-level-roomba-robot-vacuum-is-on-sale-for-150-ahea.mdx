Robot vacuums can be a huge help, keeping your floors clean regularly without much extra work on your part. Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level [Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0F468NMZH&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a1c9e24d-c2d8-4bcf-88cf-d5db8832e8d6&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Roomba+104+Vac+robot+vacuum&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3Byb2R1Y3QvQjBGNDY4Tk1aSC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTFjOWUyNGQtYzJkOC00YmNmLTg4Y2YtZDVkYjg4MzJlOGQ2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3Byb2R1Y3QvQjBGNDY4Tk1aSC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAc9lLMBoCaGJOqw21j27rhFB2dHOqZqsQF41pUGsUuyW&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0F468NMZH%2F) is available for 40 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $150. A number of other [Roombas are on sale for Black Friday](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a1c9e24d-c2d8-4bcf-88cf-d5db8832e8d6&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Roombas+are+on+sale+for+Black+Friday&custData=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&signature=AQAAATTGrz0__whIOa1F5Ck3Sk7ntRxm-A19oEzcKUh29gYL&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F7FE9A12A-454F-4760-AB69-F2E70C5447C8), too.

In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots.

An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's [favorite budget robot vacuum](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html), and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging.

This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of [its last earning statement](https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results). Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.
