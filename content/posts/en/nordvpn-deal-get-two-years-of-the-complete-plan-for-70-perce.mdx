[NordVPN](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7a83093a-241d-4ab0-89f9-72538e1530fc&featureId=text-link&merchantName=NordVPN&linkText=NordVPN&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL3ByaWNpbmcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YTgzMDkzYS0yNDFkLTRhYjAtODlmOS03MjUzOGUxNTMwZmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZHZwbi5jb20vcHJpY2luZy8ifQ&signature=AQAAAciwQ6dZZL-SLQ-iEsPwpSlvGrTDg4VsNXRXwA449O-u&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fpricing%2F) is offering a significant discount on its two-year plans, with 70 percent off its Complete tier and up to 78 percent off overall. For the Complete tier, the deal brings the total cost down to $130 for 24 months.

NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the [best VPN services](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html) thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions.

The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime.

Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our [NordVPN review](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html), the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive.

Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the [best VPN discounts](https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html) available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers.

Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. [NordPass](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e848e7ee-c601-4b49-a86b-e0340a7f4685&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7a83093a-241d-4ab0-89f9-72538e1530fc&featureId=text-link&merchantName=NordPass&linkText=NordPass&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmRwYXNzLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2E4MzA5M2EtMjQxZC00YWIwLTg5ZjktNzI1MzhlMTUzMGZjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmRwYXNzLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLyJ9&signature=AQAAAVbRq-NKHbQiBmNRvWJcYp-Pmv93ll7MBUSCzpNhkOFm&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2Fspecial%2F) is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks.

Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a [30-day money-back guarantee](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7a83093a-241d-4ab0-89f9-72538e1530fc&featureId=text-link&linkText=30-day+money-back+guarantee&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubm9yZHZwbi5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTk0NzY5OTEzMTExMjEtV2hhdC1pcy15b3VyLXJlZnVuZC1wb2xpY3kiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjdhODMwOTNhLTI0MWQtNGFiMC04OWY5LTcyNTM4ZTE1MzBmYyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm5vcmR2cG4uY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzE5NDc2OTkxMzExMTIxLVdoYXQtaXMteW91ci1yZWZ1bmQtcG9saWN5In0&signature=AQAAAb6Ol_d9IJoQj-KTOvlc_iJVh2IdAVPskwjjRyMhQfoJ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.nordvpn.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F19476991311121-What-is-your-refund-policy), so you can change your mind and get a full refund.
