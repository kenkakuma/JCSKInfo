NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that the company will "invest a great deal of money" in OpenAI's latest funding round, according to [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-31/nvidia-to-join-openai-s-current-funding-round-huang-says), after [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=07237b44-9b41-430b-9f97-9ce38adb5588&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&linkText=The+Wall+Street+Journal&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvYWkvdGhlLTEwMC1iaWxsaW9uLW1lZ2FkZWFsLWJldHdlZW4tb3BlbmFpLWFuZC1udmlkaWEtaXMtb24taWNlLWFhMzAyNWUzP3N0PXFIODJiVCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDcyMzdiNDQtOWI0MS00MzBiLTlmOTctOWNlMzhhZGI1NTg4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3RlY2gvYWkvdGhlLTEwMC1iaWxsaW9uLW1lZ2FkZWFsLWJldHdlZW4tb3BlbmFpLWFuZC1udmlkaWEtaXMtb24taWNlLWFhMzAyNWUzP3N0PXFIODJiVCJ9&signature=AQAAAVC4_nHWW40-N00b0_UEtgCAPW3tb8Xo73L78A6sC9b3&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fai%2Fthe-100-billion-megadeal-between-openai-and-nvidia-is-on-ice-aa3025e3%3Fst%3DqH82bT) on Friday reported that the two companies were rethinking a previous $100 billion deal that hasn't "progressed beyond the early stages" of negotiations. Speaking to reporters in Taipei this weekend, Huang reportedly said it could be "the largest investment we've ever made." 

NVIDIA and OpenAI jointly announced in September that NVIDIA would be [investing up to $100 billion](https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-investing-up-to-100-billion-in-openai-to-build-10-gigawatts-of-ai-data-centers-175159134.html) in OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. The companies said then that they were targeting the second half of 2026 for the first phase of the project to go online. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported that Huang has highlighted privately that the agreement was nonbinding and has criticized OpenAI's business approach as lacking discipline. 

According to _Bloomberg_, however, Huang called the report's claims "nonsense," and told reporters on Saturday, "I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” But, _Bloomberg_ reports, he said NVIDIA's investment in this funding round wouldn't come near $100 billion.
