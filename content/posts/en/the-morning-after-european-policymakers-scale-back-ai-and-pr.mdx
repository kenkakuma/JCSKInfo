Happy Friday! As the annual tech discount chaos of Black Friday approaches (good deal [here](https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-action-camera-is-on-sale-for-a-record-low-for-black-friday-160154064.html) and [here](https://www.engadget.com/deals/playstation-2025-black-friday-deals-sony-is-taking-100-off-ps5-consoles-145622303.html) and several more [here](https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-and-more-are-ready-to-shop-now-ahead-of-the-years-biggest-sale-100052033.html)), European policymakers have proposed easing some of the EU’s strictest regulations on artificial intelligence and data privacy. The move aims to remove roadblocks for tech companies and stimulate business growth in the region, potentially marking a major pivot away from the bloc’s reputation as the industry’s toughest regulator.

Changes would allow AI companies to access shared personal data to train their models, while also overhauling GDPR cookie rules. Instead of constant pop-ups, users could set preferences once in their browser and give consent with a single click. (OK, I’m onboard with that.)

Strict rules for “high-risk” AI applications, originally set for next summer, may be delayed until proper support tools are in place. Critics are warning this could be seen as Europe bowing to pressure from Big Tech and political shifts in the US. The proposal now heads to the European Parliament.

A company selling AI-enabled toys suspended sales after a consumer safety report found few restrictions on what its toys would say. The report, by the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, found FoloToy’s products would discuss everything from sexually explicit topics, like BDSM, to “advice on where a child can find matches or knives.” The toys all appear to use OpenAI’s GPT-4o model to respond naturally to children’s questions and comments. Missing from that setup was apparently hard limits on subjects the toys would respond to.

FoloToy has opted to suspend sales of its products while it conducts “a company-wide, end-to-end safety audit across all products.”

### xAI appears to be nuking posts claiming its CEO is fitter than LeBron James.

xAI is once again nuking a bunch of posts from Grok on X after the chatbot made a series of outrageous claims. The company isn’t only cleaning up a bunch of pro-Hitler posts but also a bout of cringe-inducing sycophantic praise for its CEO, Elon Musk. Over the last couple of days, Grok began offering extremely over-the-top opinions about Musk. The bot claimed Musk is the “undisputed pinnacle of holistic fitness” and that he is fitter than LeBron James (hah!). It also said he is smarter than Einstein and would win a fight against Mike Tyson.

Musk is blaming “adversarial prompting” for Grok going off the rails. “Earlier today, Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me,” he wrote. He did not explain how straightforward questions could be considered “adversarial.”

Two years ago, Ooni attempted the indoor pizza-making party with the Volt 12. It had its flaws, but there were enough redeeming features (and interest) to warrant a follow up. The Volt 2 ($699) is a complete overhaul, with a slicker design, which is slightly smaller than the first generation. It’s also cheaper than the original. Read on for the full review.

### Farewell, Friday work commitments.

The Chrono Divide project (via _PC Gamer_) lets you play the 2000 RTS _Red Alert 2_ in Chrome, Edge or Safari. It even works in mobile browsers. It supports cross-platform multiplayer using all the original maps. _Red Alert 2_’s single-player campaign modes are still a work in progress for now. The project’s website said: “The end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla _Red Alert 2_ engine.”
