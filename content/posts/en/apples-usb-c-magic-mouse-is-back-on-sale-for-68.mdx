This isn't a record-low price, but it's darned close. The mouse typically sells for $79, though today's sale only applies to the white model.

It's rare for official Apple accessories to go on sale, and the USB-C Magic Mouse is pretty much a must-have for those working on desktop computers. It's also fairly handy when combined with a laptop, letting folks avoid the trackpad.

As the name suggests, this mouse charges via USB-C. Apple stuck with replaceable AA batteries for way too long, so this change was much appreciated. A charge should power the mouse for around a month, a metric I find to be more-or-less accurate depending on usage.

This is a good mouse, and a great option for Apple devotees, but it's not without its flaws. The biggest one is port placement. The USB-C port is underneath the mouse, rendering it unusable while charging. _Bloomberg_ recently reported that a [major redesign is coming](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apples-magic-mouse-may-be-getting-a-big-makeover-in-the-next-year-or-so-174255032.html) for Apple's wireless mouse that should address that issue.
