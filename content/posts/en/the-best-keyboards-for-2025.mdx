Typing, gaming, coding or just browsing — how your fingers connect with your keyboard can change the whole feel of your setup. Whether you’re looking for something whisper-quiet and compact or a thunderous mechanical board that sings with every stroke, the best keyboards make a real difference in comfort and performance.  
  
Some people want a minimalist board that lives neatly next to their laptop or slips into a travel bag. Others need a full-size model with a numpad, dedicated macros and a build that stands up to long sessions. Today’s keyboard market is more diverse than ever. You’ll find boards designed for elegant workspace minimalism, [gaming keyboards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-keyboard-140019954.html) with aggressive RGB-lit setups and [ergonomic keyboards](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ergonomic-keyboard-130047982.html) built to reduce strain when you spend hours typing. Wireless models offer flexibility and tidy desks, while wired options still lead when speed and reliability matter most.  
  
Whether you’re upgrading your first desktop, building a pro-level gaming rig or simply looking for a board that works better day after day, we’ve found the keyboards worth your time and money.

## What to look for in a keyboard

### Design

#### **Size**

The first thing you’ll want to consider when it comes to your next computer keyboard’s design is size. There are a number of different keyboard layouts to choose from, but the most common are full-sized, tenkeyless and those smaller than tenkeyless.

Full-sized keyboards, or 100 percent, include a function row at the top and a complete numpad with arrow keys on the right side, along with all of the rest of the alphanumeric keys you’d expect on a standard QWERTY layout. Tenkeyless, or 80 percent, removes the number pad but keeps the arrow keys and the function row, reducing the overall width measurement of the board by a decent amount. Compact keyboards keep things ultra simple by including only the alphanumeric keys and modifiers like Alt, Shift, Ctrl and others and they come in different sizes like 60 percent, 65 percent and more. These are the most popular sizes out there, but you can find plenty of other designs that include different mixes of keys along with the standard letters and numbers all should have.

Aside from size, there are two other big categories that you could use to define a keyboard: ergonomic and mechanical. Ergonomic keyboards are designed with, you guessed it, better ergonomics in mind, taking into account where you should position your fingers, hands and forearms to maintain proper posture. Separately, mechanical keyboards use mechanical switches (of which there are many types) that differ greatly from the membrane or scissor-switch keyboards you’ll find dominating most wired and wireless options widely available today. We have guides to the best ergonomic keyboards and best mechanical keyboards, but we’ll summarize what you need to know about both here.

#### **Ergonomic keyboards**

If you deal with discomfort from working at a computer all day, ergonomic keyboards can help. These specially designed boards re-orient the keys, allowing you to hold your elbows farther apart and maintain a straighter line from your forearms to hands. Some people find this subtle change more comfortable.

Ergonomic keyboards typically fall into two categories: Alice and split keyboards. The former is a single unit with an A-shaped gap in the center of the keys. Split models come in two separate pieces which you can arrange as you like on your desk. Additional ergonomic features like tenting and negative tilt can make typing feel even more comfortable, and are often available on both Alice and split boards. Tenting raises the middle of the keys up so your hands take on more of a “handshake” position. Negative tilting lowers the top of the keyboard to keep your wrists angled downward instead of back towards your forearms.

The way the keys are arranged on the keyboard may make typing easier as well. Traditionally, keyboards are staggered, with one row of letters slightly offset from the row beneath it. Columnar keyboards arrange the keys in a grid of rows and columns. This style takes a little getting used to, but some people find it allows them to type faster. You can also make the keys of some keyboards do more than just produce letters. Programmable boards let you map shortcuts and other functions, including macros, which may keep you from reaching for the mouse quite so often, saving you time and possibly strain as well.

**Mechanical keyboards**

Mechanical keyboards have blown up in popularity as more people have been thrust into creating their own workspaces at home. It’s easy to see why: Compared to a traditional membrane keyboard, a good mechanical board is more durable, more satisfying to press and, most importantly, infinitely more customizable. The best of them usually come with a price premium, but even some cheaper models let you “hot-swap” between keycaps, switches and other materials, letting you tinker with different typing sensations and sound profiles until you find a combination that best expresses your preferences.

Do you want each press to feel deep and full or fast and light? Do you need them to sound loud and clacky or almost [totally muffled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY36UuNmboI)? Do you prefer your keycaps to look subdued and professional, stuffed with RGB lights or written in an [Elvish language](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=62223d33-ce58-4fd5-8043-71de4e3413fa&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=81d60284-7f82-4327-82da-b3990f7b115e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Drop&linkText=Elvish+language&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ryb3AuY29tL2J1eS9kcm9wLXRoZS1sb3JkLW9mLXRoZS1yaW5ncy1tdDMtZWx2ZW4ta2V5Y2FwLXNldD9kZWZhdWx0U2VsZWN0aW9uSWRzPTk2NDY2NyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODFkNjAyODQtN2Y4Mi00MzI3LTgyZGEtYjM5OTBmN2IxMTVlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ryb3AuY29tL2J1eS9kcm9wLXRoZS1sb3JkLW9mLXRoZS1yaW5ncy1tdDMtZWx2ZW4ta2V5Y2FwLXNldD9kZWZhdWx0U2VsZWN0aW9uSWRzPTk2NDY2NyJ9&signature=AQAAAeIi37NvKJ2ZCd-Ma-1LUvfmnyzMzcBzVtN4oqGOK-AM&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-the-lord-of-the-rings-mt3-elven-keycap-set%3FdefaultSelectionIds%3D964667) from The Lord of the Rings for some reason? With the right new keyboard, it’s all up to you — the only things really holding you back are your imagination and your wallet.

We have a dedicated buying guide that digs deeper into the key aspects to consider when buying a [mechanical](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mechanical-keyboard-120050723.html) gaming keyboard, so we encourage you to look at that for a full rundown. To keep things high-level, the most influential part of your purchase is your keyboard’s switch type. These little mechanisms slot underneath the keycaps and generally have the biggest effect on how your keyboard feels and sounds as you type away.

You can broadly separate mechanical switches into three buckets: linear, tactile and clicky. Linear switches feel smooth all the way down; they’re often popular with gamers since they tend to be light and fast to actuate. Tactile switches create a tangible “bump” sensation partway through a press; many people who spend all day typing prefer them because they clearly confirm each press without (always) being all that loud. Clicky switches are functionally similar to tactiles but make an audible “click” sound to match the bump; your coworkers may hate them, but others love the full-throated sense of feedback they provide. To be clear, just because two switches fall within the same bucket doesn’t mean they feel or sound exactly the same. The only way to figure out which switch works best for you is to do your research and, preferably, try some out for yourself.

Other keyboards have a mechanical-style feel but are built on different mechanisms entirely. The hot new trend in gaming-focused keyboards, for example, is [Hall effect](https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-the-last-gamepad-ill-need-to-buy-for-switch-and-pc-140047518.html) switches, which use tiny magnets to register keystrokes and let you customize the sensitivity of each press. Optical switches, meanwhile, offer similar functionality by replacing the physical contact point of a typical mechanical switch with a beam of infrared light. More recently, we’ve seen a [couple](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/ducky-one-x-full-size-inductive-keyboard) [keyboards](https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-magcore-87) launch with inductive switches, which can work like magnetic switches [but use](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/duckys-worlds-first-inductive-keyboard-offers-cherry-analog-switches-and-wirelessbut-is-it-better-than-hall-effect/) inductive coils in the keyboard’s printed circuit board (PCB) to cater to all switches collectively and don’t require a sensor for each individual switch. We touch on a couple of magnetic-switch keyboards in our picks below, but for a fuller breakdown of this sort of tech, we recommend you check out our dedicated buying guide to the [best gaming keyboards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-keyboard-140019954.html).

### Connectivity

You’ve got two options here: wired or wireless. Wired keyboards typically have an attached cable that plugs into a USB-A or USB-C port on your computer (or docking station), although some come with cables that can be removed. Wireless mechanical keyboards connect to your machine either via Bluetooth or a wireless receiver dongle. There’s always the chance of some latency with wireless keyboards, so keep that in mind if you’re picking one up to use primarily with a gaming PC. Of course, you’ll only have to worry about battery life with Bluetooth keyboards.
