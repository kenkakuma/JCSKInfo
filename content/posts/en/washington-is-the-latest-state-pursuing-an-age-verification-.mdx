Washington state residents may soon be forced to produce IDs before getting onto websites with pornographic content. Within the state's House of Representatives, Rep. Mari Leavitt introduced [House Bill 2112](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=2112&Year=2025&Initiative=false), which is informally known as the Keep Our Children Safe Act. Similar to the initiatives seen in [other states](https://www.engadget.com/louisiana-government-id-to-access-porn-online-065536172.html), the bill proposes to restrict access to "online sexual material harmful" to anyone under 18.

In practical terms, those living in Washington state could see websites asking for digital identification or demanding the user go through an age verification system that requests a government-issued ID. If a website that has more than one-third of its content being "sexual material harmful to minors" is found not following these rules, the state's attorney general can pursue steep civil penalties.

If those restrictions sound familiar, it's because many [other states](https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-to-leave-five-more-states-over-age-verification-laws-194906657.html) have also passed similar constraints. Washington state's proposed bill is very similar to Texas' age verification law that went into effect in September 2023 and was recently upheld by the [US Supreme Court](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/supreme-court-upholds-texass-porn-site-age-verification-law-155007840.html). Like the Texas law, several groups expressed disapproval of the bill during the public hearing at the House committee level. As reported by [_The Seattle Times_](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-age-verification-bill-targets-access-to-online-adult-content/)_,_ groups including the ACLU, Lavender Rights Project and the Northwest Progressive Institute warned of privacy risks related to potential data breaches and the loose definition of "sexual material harmful to minors" in the bill's language.
