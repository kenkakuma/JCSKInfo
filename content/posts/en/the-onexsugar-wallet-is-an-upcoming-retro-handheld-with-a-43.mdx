OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company that isn't afraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its [transforming dual-screen gaming portable](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/next-gen-snapdragon-g-series-chips-will-power-handhelds-from-ayaneo-onexsugar-and-retroid-pocket-131733930.html).) Its latest venture is another retro gaming handheld that, at first glance, looks like a standard dual-screen model. But the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet uses a single foldable screen instead.

The device was teased via a [54-second video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eyvWBVE3y/) on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. _Retro Handhelds_ [reports](https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/) that the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. (That's a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded.) The video also shows an asymmetrical analog stick layout with a D-pad and four action buttons.

Given foldable phones’ [long-term durability concerns](https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-motorola-razr-cnet-fold-test.html), we aren't necessarily betting on the OneXSugar Wallet being a wise purchase. We also don't know how much it will cost. (The aforementioned weird dual-screen device [retails](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ac10bd63-48b3-4735-b93e-1db00401354f&featureId=text-link&linkText=retails&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL29uZXhwbGF5ZXJzdG9yZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvb25leHN1Z2FyLXN1Z2FyLTEtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtZmlyc3QtdHJhbnNmb3JtYWJsZS1kdWFsLXNjcmVlbi1oYW5kaGVsZC1jb25zb2xlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYzEwYmQ2My00OGIzLTQ3MzUtYjkzZS0xZGIwMDQwMTM1NGYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vb25leHBsYXllcnN0b3JlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vbmV4c3VnYXItc3VnYXItMS10aGUtd29ybGQtcy1maXJzdC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hYmxlLWR1YWwtc2NyZWVuLWhhbmRoZWxkLWNvbnNvbGUifQ&signature=AQAAAR9cleN-aI8ZPxrVFPxX0pq1E1ezVsyEcTeNzQHKsofF&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fonexplayerstore.com%2Fproducts%2Fonexsugar-sugar-1-the-world-s-first-transformable-dual-screen-handheld-console) for a whopping $799.) But at the very least, don't be shocked if the novel form factor ends up sparking a few copycats in the competitive retro gaming industry.
