Typography nerds and Android fans, rejoice: You can now download an official version of “the next generation of Google’s brand typeface.” The company has released the Google Sans Flex font to the public for free.

The variable sans-serif font is part of [Google's Material 3 design language](https://www.engadget.com/google-rollout-new-look-docs-workspace-apps-124542742.html), which arrived in 2023. _9to5Google_ [notes](https://9to5google.com/2025/11/18/google-sans-flex-font-available/) that it's since been integrated into many of the company's products, including in some corners of Pixel software.

A 2024 Google Design [blog post](https://design.google/library/variable-fonts-type) about variable typography highlights the font's flexibility, as seen in the image above. Casey Henry, a designer with the company, wrote that Google Sans Flex "allows the font's letterforms to shape-shift at different scales." [OpenType Font Variations](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-opentype-font-variations.html) is the standard Google uses for variable fonts.

Meanwhile, a Reddit thread about the download dove deeper into typography nerdery. “Interesting behaviour when you condense the width,” u/hbpencil102 [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/1ozdu65/finally_the_google_font_google_sans_is_opensource/). “Instead of circles becoming ovals, they become more rectangular with rounded tops and bottoms, reminding me of DIN 1451.” Amen to that.

You can download Google Sans Flex from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Google+Sans+Flex/about).
