Before [Electronic Arts](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-delays-battlefield-6-season-2-to-february-17-180306743.html) goes private in a groundbreaking sale, some US lawmakers are pleading for some federal oversight. Democratic members of the US Congress, as part of the [Congressional Labor Caucus](https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf), penned a letter asking the Federal Trade Commission to "thoroughly review" the $55 billion acquisition of EA.

[EA confirmed](https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html) the sale to the Public Investment Fund, or the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in September, but the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2027. Before the official change of ownership, the 46 House Democrats who signed the letter to the FTC are calling for more scrutiny into the impacts of the deal. 

The letter noted some of the most consequential effects, including the worsening of an unstable industry, the potential for more layoffs and increased [market dominance](https://www.engadget.com/ea-purchasing-glu-mobile-045832340.html) for EA. "We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes," the letter read.

The letter already earned support from the Communications Workers of America union, who also supported a petition from the [United Video Games](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better) union. As spotted by [_Eurogamer_](https://www.eurogamer.net/uvw-union-fed-trade-commission-letter-petition), the petition calls on regulators and elected officials to "scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs and preserves creative freedom."
