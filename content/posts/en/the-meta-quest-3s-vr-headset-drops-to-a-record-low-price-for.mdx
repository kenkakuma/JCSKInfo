Meta's entry-level VR headset, the Quest 3S, is down to an even more budget-friendly price than usual in a deal on Amazon right now. The [128GB Meta Quest 3S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0F2GYMC8H&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b3f467f0-8df8-4e31-b1a2-b1f42eaeea70&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=128GB+Meta+Quest+3S&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL01ldGEtUXVlc3QtM1MtMjU2R0ItQWxsLU9uZS9kcC9CMEYyR1lNQzhIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIzZjQ2N2YwLThkZjgtNGUzMS1iMWEyLWIxZjQyZWFlZWE3MCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NZXRhLVF1ZXN0LTNTLTI1NkdCLUFsbC1PbmUvZHAvQjBGMkdZTUM4SCIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAARrNxVSmTp-10WQyu58deTxsbY3RfbXnGcnYAFlhr7Yd&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMeta-Quest-3S-256GB-All-One%2Fdp%2FB0F2GYMC8H) is 17 percent off in an early Black Friday deal, bringing it to a record-low price of $250. It normally goes for $300. With the purchase, you also get the game _Gorilla Tag_ for free. There's also a 256GB option, which is on sale as well and comes with _Batman: Arkham Shadow_. That version costs $330, down from its usual price of $400.

The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a [90 in Engadget's review](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html), landing it among our picks for [the best VR headsets](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html) around right now. It's comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn't quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM.

The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience. In his review, Engadget's Devindra Hardawar said the 3S is "the best $300 standalone VR headset we've ever seen."
