Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.  
  
We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you.

### Dyson Gen 5 Detect

The [Dyson Gen 5 Detect](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b96b196-8902-4854-bf81-2e614eba034c&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a05e054c-6375-4b7d-a26a-4eb4c914105a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Dyson&linkText=Dyson+Gen+5+Detect&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5keXNvbi5jb20vdmFjdXVtLWNsZWFuZXJzL2NvcmRsZXNzL2dlbjUvZGV0ZWN0LWhlcGEtcHVycGxlLWlyb24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEwNWUwNTRjLTYzNzUtNGI3ZC1hMjZhLTRlYjRjOTE0MTA1YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZHlzb24uY29tL3ZhY3V1bS1jbGVhbmVycy9jb3JkbGVzcy9nZW41L2RldGVjdC1oZXBhLXB1cnBsZS1pcm9uIn0&signature=AQAAASo_xNeXwz8F4fgAkHVeTpDHJvqtwzjOFqw_6SAyxjFH&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fgen5%2Fdetect-hepa-purple-iron) has a single-button start and stronger suction power than our top pick, but it’s otherwise quite similar. However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year.

### Levoit Aero

The biggest selling point of the [Levoit Aero](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DLWJLN2W&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a05e054c-6375-4b7d-a26a-4eb4c914105a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Levoit+Aero&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0xFVk9JVC1DbGVhbi1FbXB0eS1MaWdodHdlaWdodC1SZWNoYXJnZWFibGUvZHAvQjBETFdKTE4yVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTA1ZTA1NGMtNjM3NS00YjdkLWEyNmEtNGViNGM5MTQxMDVhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0xFVk9JVC1DbGVhbi1FbXB0eS1MaWdodHdlaWdodC1SZWNoYXJnZWFibGUvZHAvQjBETFdKTE4yVy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAafvJzIFUbqdOuIYsqDnWvS01av_DPzg5yVQniZh8JZ7&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEVOIT-Clean-Empty-Lightweight-Rechargeable%2Fdp%2FB0DLWJLN2W%2F) is the attached bin into which the vacuum will empty its dustbin when you press a button once it's docked after a cleaning. I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the "self" part isn't really there — instead, there's a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It's convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well.

### LG CordZero Q3

The $329 [CordZero Q3](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a05e054c-6375-4b7d-a26a-4eb4c914105a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LG+Electronics&linkText=CordZero+Q3&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvdmFjdXVtLWNsZWFuZXJzL2xnLWM1MzIzYjAtc3RpY2stdmFjdXVtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMDVlMDU0Yy02Mzc1LTRiN2QtYTI2YS00ZWI0YzkxNDEwNWEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnLmNvbS91cy92YWN1dW0tY2xlYW5lcnMvbGctYzUzMjNiMC1zdGljay12YWN1dW0ifQ&signature=AQAAAW4Tk3lvvA0arVA-WTVxWaX6Nf1qG8mdu-XTCGwkjE9X&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Flg-c5323b0-stick-vacuum) is a perfectly capable vacuum with a single-button start, two manual power modes, adjustable suction technology that detects carpets and hard flooring and a cleaner head outfitted with LEDs to help you better spot all the dirt on your floors. But it's ultimately _just fine_ in comparison to our top picks; it's not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it's just awkward) and it doesn't have the smoothest handling.

### Shark Detect Pro

The [Shark Detect Pro](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0C9FZ6RHP&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a05e054c-6375-4b7d-a26a-4eb4c914105a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Shark+Detect+Pro&custData=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&signature=AQAAAfq1K4egvi_6K6zVb6KRe7hwahw8c39sQdIhuP_8xvXZ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShark-IW3511-Auto-Empty-Multi-Surface-Multi-Tool%2Fdp%2FB0C9FZ6RHP%2F) provides a lot of value for the money, but it was ultimately beat by the Tineco Pure One Station 5 for our runner-up slot thanks to the Tineco’s stronger suction power. The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture.

## Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum

### Design and bin capacity

Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices.

Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners.

Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session.

If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum.

### Suction and power modes

Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power.

Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength.

Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible.

If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs.

### Floor type

The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it's still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet.

### Battery life

Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy.

### Base style

Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby.

Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris.

### “Smart” features

Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area.

Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the [best robot vacuums](https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html), or even the [best budget robot vacuums](https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html), which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t _need_ Wi-Fi or an app connectivity.

### Price

Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more.

## How we test cordless vacuums

Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot.

## Cordless stick vacuums FAQs

### How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum?

Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster.

### Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones?

Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room.

### Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair?

Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing.

### What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner?

Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back.

Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh.

Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick.

### Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery?

Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.
