An upcoming update to Steam includes a helpful improvement to game reviews. As part of the [Steam Client Beta update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053?emclan=103582791433918461&emgid=505101717860253962) Valve released on February 12, users will now be able to attach information about their hardware specifications when they post a new game review or update an old one.

It's not uncommon to find negative reviews that complain about a game's performance, information that's hard to draw a conclusion from without knowing what kind of hardware the reviewer is using. With specs attached, the usefulness of complaints becomes a little bit easier to gauge. A game's sales performance and [discoverability on Steam](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-steam-review-changes-perpetuate-a-vicious-cycle) is heavily influenced by its review average, a data point Steam users sometimes manipulate for reasons unconnected to the quality of a game. Provided reviewers actually attach their specs — at least in the beta, the feature is entirely optional — Valve's mercurial reviews ecosystem could end up becoming more nuanced overall.

Alongside the new option in reviews, Valve is also experimenting with a way for users to share "anonymized framerate data" with the company. When framerate sharing is enabled, "Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve says. The feature is specifically focused on devices running SteamOS, Valve's Linux-based operating system for the Steam Deck and some [third-party handhelds](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos-review-a-purpose-built-os-makes-all-the-difference-120059561.html). The extra information could help the company's attempts to improve game compatibility using software like [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton).

The beta update also includes bug fixes, and a tweak to how Valve collects feedback about whether a game should be [Deck Verified](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified). Now when Steam prompts you to confirm whether you agree with a game's rating, if you disagree, you can provide a reason as to why.
