Between the new Macs, iPhones and rumored AI gadgets, Apple surprised us with an upgraded, second-generation AirTag. It has Apple’s latest Ultra Wideband chip — the same one used in the iPhone 17 lineup and the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It also uses Precision Finding to reach items up to 50 percent further away than the previous AirTag model. This feature will now work with any Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 or newer.

Apple

Apple says the new tag is 50 percent louder and features a “distinctive new chime.” So you can show off that you’ve got the new kind of AirTag. Sadly, there’s still no keyring hole, so you might want to invest in a holder… with a keyring. There are [cheaper options](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html) than Apple’s leather version, fortunately. I personally like Elevation Lab’s [AirTag Wallet Holder](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B09GTVRVLC&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d5266c30-1b66-4afa-a87a-6a3062069221&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=AirTag+Wallet+Holder&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwOUdUVlJWTEM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDUyNjZjMzAtMWI2Ni00YWZhLWE4N2EtNmEzMDYyMDY5MjIxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwOUdUVlJWTEMiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAWzh-nSPHW0Ju1gLNm4yp-omGfa91TLCNgsKfyPUYNB8&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09GTVRVLC).

Capcom

](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-preview-150000849.html)

Capcom is attempting a delicate balancing act with _Resident Evil Requiem_. The ninth mainline entry seems to split between the gory action of _Resident Evil 4_ and the claustrophobic dread of _Resident Evil 7_. After a four-hour hands-on, the distinction is clear: Leon Kennedy handles the heavy lifting with (mostly) violence, while newcomer Grace navigates a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse in a hospital filled with zombies and other monstrosities.

_Requiem_ introduces “nuanced” zombies who retain fragments of their past lives — think blind patients or territorial chefs you can distract.

## [A TikTok US power outage caused a ‘cascading systems failure’](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-tiktok-us-power-outage-caused-a-cascading-systems-failure-leading-to-multiple-bugs-173426490.html)

**There were a lot of bugs.**

TikTok says it’s still working to fix the “multiple bugs” in its US service following a power outage at one of its data centers. Users are having issues logging in and uploading videos and are seeing strange behavior from the “for you” algorithm. Some creators have also noticed that new uploads seem to be getting no views or likes.

The company released a statement yesterday saying a power outage had caused a “cascading systems failure” that is still affecting the app. The statement, however, didn’t address reported issues with the app’s recommendation algorithm. Since Sunday, users have reported seeing a wave of generic videos flood their feeds, which are usually hyper-personalized to the user.

## [Apple may have its Gemini-powered Siri ready by February](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-plans-to-reveal-its-gemini-powered-siri-in-february-174356923.html)

**It will reportedly show off the revamped Siri in ‘the second half of February.’**

According to _Bloomberg_’s Mark Gurman, Apple plans to reveal its new Siri in “the second half of February,” demonstrating some new Gemini-powered capabilities — whatever they may be. 

After this, Gurman said the new Siri will be available in iOS 26.4, which is also slated to enter beta testing in February before its public release in March or early April. It’s been a long time coming; Apple teased its next-gen Siri back at WWDC 2024, but it’s still not made it to devices.
