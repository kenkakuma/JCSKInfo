OpenAI gave its AI chatbot a professional makeover with the latest [GPT-5.2 release](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html), and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1przx5w/are_they_giving_gpt_more_independence_or_what_ive/) [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ps0qxm/chatgpt_becoming_very_sassy_and_humbling_recently/) are already complaining about its tone. For anyone who's finding ChatGPT rude or sassy, OpenAI has some welcome news since it's letting users further customize its personality with extra warmth or enthusiasm.

In a [post on X](https://x.com/openai/status/2002099459883479311), OpenAI revealed that users can adjust characteristics under new Warm, Enthusiastic, Header & Lists and Emoji options found in the Personalization settings. Between the four options, you can choose between more, less or default to fine-tune exactly how you want ChatGPT to sound in its responses. These new characteristics come about a month after OpenAI added Professional, Candid and Quirky options to [GPT-5.1](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/) under the "Base style and tone" setting that's also found in the Personalization tab.

The latest customizations likely stem from the fiasco that OpenAI faced earlier this year when it rolled out GPT-5 to replace [GPT-4o](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html). The outcry from users revolved around the latest update sounding less conversational and friendly, leading OpenAI to offer the option to choose between models and promising to make GPT-5 feel warmer.
