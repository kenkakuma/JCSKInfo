Amazon has responded to viewers catching errors in its AI-generated season recaps by apparently pulling them from Prime Video. The company [announced its new Video Recaps feature](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-adds-ai-generated-video-recaps-for-select-prime-video-shows-190758346.html) in November as a way to make it easier to jump into a new season of a show, but the feature had issues: [A recap created for _Fallout_](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-ai-generated-recap-tool-didnt-watch-fallout-very-closely-215712958.html) included factual errors about the plot and the setting of the show.

On Prime Video, recaps can be played in the "Extras" section if you're watching on the web, or via a dedicated "recap button" on the show's page, according to Amazon's original [Video Recaps announcement](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/ai-plot-summary-video-recaps-prime-video). If you head to the _Fallout s_eason two page now, the erroneous recap has been removed. In fact, at least on the web, there are currently no video recaps available on the show's Amazon was testing the feature on, which includes _Fallout, Bosch, Upload, The Rig_ and _Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan_.

Engadget has contacted Amazon for more information on why the recaps were removed. We'll update this article if we hear back.

Video Recaps are just one of the ways Amazon is trying to integrate AI into its different products and services. The company offered AI-generated English dubs for select anime shows on Prime Video, before it [pulled the dubs](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/amazon-halts-ai-anime-dub-beta-after-widespread-ridicule-141501051.html) after users complained. Amazon also uses AI to [generate recaps](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-will-use-ai-to-generate-recaps-for-book-series-on-the-kindle-170018503.html) for long-running book series that are sold through the Kindle Store.
