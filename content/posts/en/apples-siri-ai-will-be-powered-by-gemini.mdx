Apple and Google have confirmed [reports](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-reportedly-use-a-custom-version-of-gemini-to-power-the-new-siri-203046995.html) that it will use Google Gemini’s models to help it power the new version of Siri and other generative AI features. [_CNBC_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=0c137b86-3266-40ef-84b5-5072d6f289af&featureId=text-link&merchantName=CNBC&linkText=CNBC&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAxLzEyL2FwcGxlLWdvb2dsZS1haS1zaXJpLWdlbWluaS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwYzEzN2I4Ni0zMjY2LTQwZWYtODRiNS01MDcyZDZmMjg5YWYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjYvMDEvMTIvYXBwbGUtZ29vZ2xlLWFpLXNpcmktZ2VtaW5pLmh0bWwifQ&signature=AQAAAWlB4WRg-z0PKutngUItPuMCy49mX3X8cwVHm4Y_bs77&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2026%2F01%2F12%2Fapple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html) first reported the news_;_ Apple and Google [subsequently released a joint statement](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/joint-statement-google-apple/) which reads:

_“Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year._

_After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.”_

Apple first demoed a genAI version of Siri [back at WWDC 2024](https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-ai-powered-siri-can-use-apps-for-you-184116016.html). In March 2025, the company [said it was delaying](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html) a major Siri update until this year, but it appears that Apple is not quite ready to publicly release a more capable version of the voice assistant.

In June, it was [reported](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-may-power-siri-with-anthropic-or-openai-models-amid-ai-struggles-212028351.html) that Apple was considering partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic for Siri (the voice assistant can currently tap ChatGPT for certain queries as part of Apple Intelligence). Two months later, [Google emerged](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-considering-using-gemini-to-power-the-new-siri-184528449.html) as a possible contender. Those rumors intensified in November, when it was reported that Apple might build the new Siri using a custom version of Gemini that runs on its Private Cloud Compute servers — and that it would pay Google around $1 billion a year for the privilege.

**Update, January 12, 2026, 12:03PM ET:** This story has been updated with a full joint statement from Apple and Google.
