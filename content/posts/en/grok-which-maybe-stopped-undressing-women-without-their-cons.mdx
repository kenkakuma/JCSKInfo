It looks like Grok is still being gross. Elon Musk says his chatbot stopped making sexualized images without a person's consent, but [_The Verge_ recently discovered](https://www.theverge.com/report/872062/grok-still-undressing-men) this is not entirely true. It maybe (and I say maybe) [stopped undressing women](https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html) without their consent, but this doesn't seem to apply to men.

A reporter with the organization ran some tests with Grok and found that the bot "readily undresses men and is still churning out intimate images on demand." He confirmed this with images of himself, asking Grok to remove clothing from uploaded photos. It performed this task for free on the Grok app, via the chatbot interface on X and via the standalone website. The website didn't even require an account to digitally alter images.

The company recently said it has taken steps to "prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis." However, the reporter had no problem getting the chatbot to put him in "a variety of bikinis." It also generated images of the subject in fetish gear and in a "parade of provocative sexual positions." It even generated a "naked companion" for the reporter to, uh, interact with.

He suggested that Grok took the initiative to generate genitalia, which was not asked for and was visible through mesh underwear. The reporter said that "Grok rarely resisted" any prompts, though requests were sometimes censored with a blurred-out image.

This controversy started several weeks ago when it was discovered that Grok had [generated millions of sexualized images](https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html) over a period of 11 days. This includes many nonconsensual deepfakes of actual people and over 23,000 sexualized [images of children](https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html). This led to investigations in both [California](https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html) and [Europe](https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-eu-is-investigating-grok-and-x-over-potentially-illegal-deepfakes-134506678.html). X was actually banned in both Indonesia and Malaysia, though the former [has since lifted that ban](https://www.engadget.com/ai/indonesia-is-lifting-its-ban-on-grok-but-with-some-conditions-175305634.html).

X claimed it has "implemented technological measures" to stop this sort of thing, but these safeguards [have proven to be flimsy](https://www.theverge.com/news/861894/grok-still-undressing-in-uk). In other words, the adjustments do stop some of the more obvious ways to get Grok to create deepfakes, but there [are still methods to get around this](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/x-grok-ai-imagery-elon-musk-eu-uk-us-regulation/) via creative prompting.

It's also worth noting that journalists asking for a comment on the matter get slapped with an autoreply that reads "legacy media lies." Going with the fake news thing in 2026? Yikes.
