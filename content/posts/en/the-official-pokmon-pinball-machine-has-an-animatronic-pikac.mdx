At a staggering starting price of $6,999, you have a better chance of buying a bicycle in Cerulean City than getting your hands on the official [Pokémon pinball machine](https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/). The collaboration between [The Pokémon Company](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-is-so-damn-cozy-140000954.html) International and Stern Pinball is undoubtedly nostalgic, letting you battle with a team that includes Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle and Pikachu, as well as catch up to 182 different Pokémon, mostly from the Kanto region, with more to be added.

Besides catching 'em all and tracking your growing Pokédex on Stern Pinball's [dedicated app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stern-pinball-ic/id6449461651), you can do Gym Battles in four different biomes and eventually face off against Team Rocket. The pinball machine draws a lot of inspiration from the [original cartoon](https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-27-netflix-captures-pokemon-cartoons-movies-this-march.html), including a monitor that plays clips from the show, an animatronic Pikachu, and speakers that can play the iconic theme song.

Stern Pinball developed Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models, which can cost all the way up to $12,999. For the most expensive option, you'll get one of the 750 limited edition machines that include a Master Ball plunger, a numbered plaque and a signed certificate of authenticity. For Pokémon fans that can't afford to spend that much money on a pinball machine, you can soon find them at arcades and bowling alleys instead.
