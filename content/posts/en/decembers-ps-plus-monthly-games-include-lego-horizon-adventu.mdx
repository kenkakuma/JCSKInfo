Sony has revealed the [final batch](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/) of PlayStation Plus Monthly Games for 2025. This time around, you’ll be able to add five games to your library instead of the usual three. As ever, you’ll retain access to claimed games as long as your subscription remains active.

The headliner this time around is [_Lego Horizon Adventures_](https://www.engadget.com/lego-horizon-adventures-might-be-sonys-most-important-game-of-the-year-160026354.html) (PS5), which is a more family-friendly take on the Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo gave the events of _Horizon Zero Dawn_ a Lego flavor in this spinoff, which is the first co-op game in the series ([an MMO is in the pipeline too](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-latest-horizon-spin-off-is-an-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile-but-not-ps5-153532860.html)). I’ve been meaning to check this out, so it’ll be an easy addition to my library.

The same goes for [_Neon White_](https://www.engadget.com/neon-white-switch-steam-ben-esposito-interview-183854914.html) (PS4 and PS5), a fast-paced precision platformer and first-person shooter that’s also part-dating sim. Each level is a race to the exit but you’ll need to defeat every demon in the stage first.

There are a couple of first-person co-op horror games in the December lineup. Those are the action-focused title _Killing Floor 3_ (PS5) and the psychological survival horror _The Outlast Trials_ (PS4 and PS5). The final entry in the Monthly Games lineup this time around is extraction shooter _Synduality Echo of Ada_ (PS5). That could help you scratch an _Arc Raiders_\-shaped itch if you don’t fancy shelling out for that particular game right now.

All five games will be available for PS Plus Essential, Extra and Premium members to snag on December 2 and they’ll remain up for grabs until January 5. You still have until December 1 to scoop up [November’s PS Plus Monthly Games](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/stray-leads-novembers-lineup-of-ps-plus-games-180339318.html), which are _EA Sports WRC 24_, _Totally Accurate Battle Simulator_ and the wonderful _Stray_.

[At the beginning of this year,](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/februarys-modest-playstation-plus-selection-includes-high-on-life-and-payday-3-184559839.html) Sony said it planned to stop offering PS4 games as a “key benefit” on the PS Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog lineups as of January 2026. While it might add PS4 games from time to time, the onus for PS Plus going forward will be on PS5 (and perhaps some PS VR2) games. Of course, any PS4 Monthly Games that you’ve claimed will still remain available for download as long as your PS Plus subscription remains active.
