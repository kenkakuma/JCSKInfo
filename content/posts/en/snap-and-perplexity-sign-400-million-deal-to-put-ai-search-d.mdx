Snap and Perplexity AI have struck a $400 million deal that will bring the AI search engine directly to Snapchat sometime in "early 2026," the two companies [announced](https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2025/Snap-and-Perplexity-Partner-to-Bring-Conversational-AI-Search-to-Snapchat/default.aspx). With the partnership, Perplexity's AI search engine will be a prominent part of Snapchat's "chat" interface so users can "ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat."

The news was announced alongside the company's third-quarter earnings. The company said that revenue from the deal — Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million for the integration — is "expected to begin contributing" to the company's bottom line in 2026. In [a letter](https://investor.snap.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Investor-Letter.pdf) to shareholders, CEO Evan Spiegel also hinted that Snap could pursue similar partnerships with other AI companies. "This collaboration makes AI-powered discovery native to Snapchat, enhances personalization, and positions Snap as a leading distribution channel for intelligent agents, laying the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of AI partners to reach our global community," he wrote. 

Snap, like its peers, has been leaning into generative AI in recent years. The company has its own LLM-powered chatbot, called MyAI, which [uses models](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snap-is-redesigning-snapchat-and-adding-new-ai-powers-171552703.html) from OpenAI, Google and, soon, Perplexity AI. Snap has also introduced AI-powered [lenses](https://www.engadget.com/apps/snapchat-launches-generative-ai-video-lenses-130056731.html) and [creation tools](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-now-has-a-standalone-app-for-making-gen-ai-augmented-reality-effects-170036214.html), which have helped boost its Snapchat+ subscription service.  

Spiegel also teased other AI-powered updates coming to Snapchat. He said the company is working on a new AI video generation feature called "AI Clips" that "will allow creators to generate short, shareable videos from simple prompts." He didn’t say when the feature might launch.

Outside of Snapchat, Snap is also planning on launching a new version of its AR glasses, called Specs, s[ometime next year](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html). Spiegel didn’t offer any new details about the device, which he has previously promised will be lighter-weight than the current version. He did, however, suggest the company was considering working with potential hardware partners. He said Snap would be “putting Specs into their own standalone, 100% owned subsidiary” to give the company more flexibility to pursue such arrangements.

**Update, November 5, 2025, 3:08PM PT:** Added more details from Snap’s earnings call.
