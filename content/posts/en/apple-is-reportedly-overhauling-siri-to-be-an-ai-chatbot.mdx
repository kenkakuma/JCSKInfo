Apple has been spinning its wheels for many months over its approach to artificial intelligence, but a strategy finally appears to be emerging for the company. _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2OTAyNDk2NywiZXhwIjoxNzY5NjI5NzY3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFRXOVlLR0NURlUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJDNEVEQ0FFMUZBMDU0MEJFQTI0QTlGMjExQzFFOTA4MCJ9.awOoIDGdEkCAvho8waoXR6VVVojI3jGvQHJeDjwcyrs&leadSource=uverify%20wall) today that Apple's long-awaited Siri overhaul will allegedly involve transforming the voice assistant into an AI chatbot, internally called Campos. 

Sources have reportedly told Gurman that Apple chatbot will completely replace the current Siri interface in favor of a more interactive model similar to those used by OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. He also cited sources who claimed that while Apple has been testing a standalone Campos app, the company doesn't plan to release it for customers. Instead, the new chatbot will emphasize deep software integrations when it rolls out, reportedly as part of the iOS 27, iPadOS 27 and macOS 27 wave late next year. However, there will reportedly be a new features for the current iteration Siri coming in the iOS 26.4. Those additions will include the [much-delayed](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-ai-infused-siri-may-not-show-up-until-spring-2026-221212681.html) updates Apple first promised for the platform back in 2024.

Pivoting to a chatbot gives some additional context to Apple's recent move to collaborate with frequent rival Google; the companies [announced](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html) earlier in January that Gemini models will be used to power the upcoming versions of Siri. Gemini has become [ubiquitous](https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-pull-context-the-rest-of-your-google-apps-if-you-let-it-160039468.html) in the Google ecosystem, and it makes sense for Apple to leverage outside help in this segment where it has already been [trailing its competitors](https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html). 

 Although Apple may not have a standalone app for its Siri chatbot, the company does appear to be considering new places to host its AI resource. Additional reports today claimed that 2027 could also see the release of a [wearable AI pin](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-is-reportedly-developing-a-wearable-ai-pin-204705065.html).
