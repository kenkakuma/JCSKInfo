Sony just announced January's Game Catalog [additions for PS Plus subscribers](https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/) and it's a fantastic lineup. All of these titles will be ready to play on January 20.

First up, there's _Resident Evil Village_. This is a [direct sequel to](https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-release-date-may-7-2021-224214298.html) 2017’s _Resident Evil 7: Biohazard_. It's a full game with plenty of jump scares and an engrossing narrative. It's set in a spooky village, thus the name, and a nearby castle. This shouldn't disappoint fans of the franchise and will be available for both PS4 and PS5.

_Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth_ [is a 2024 sequel to](https://www.engadget.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-make-you-see-ichibans-bare-butt-in-early-2024-175557876.html) _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_. It was a massive hit upon release, thanks to solid RPG mechanics and a truly unique sense of humor. There are minigames that parody both Pokémon and Animal Crossing. The combat and movement have also both been enhanced since the last entry. It'll be playable on both PS4 and PS5.

_Expeditions: A MudRunner Game_ is a neat little riff on a driving sim, mixing in other genres. The meat and potatoes involve driving an off-road vehicle to locate treasures and uncover secrets, but there's also a base-building element. It'll be available for both PS4 and PS5.

That's really just the tip of the iceberg. This is a big month for PS Plus subscribers. Other titles dropping on January 20 include the iconic roguelike _Darkest Dungeon II_ and the horror adventure _A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead_.
