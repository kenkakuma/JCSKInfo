Electronic Arts [has announced](https://www.ea.com/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai) a new partnership with Stability AI, the creator of AI image generation tool [Stable Diffusion](https://www.engadget.com/ai/stable-diffusion-35-follows-your-prompts-more-closely-and-generates-more-diverse-people-184022965.html). The company will "co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows" for the game developer, with the hopes of speeding up development while maintaining quality.

"I use the term smarter paintbrushes,” Steve Kestell, Head of Technical Art for EA SPORTS said in the announcement. "We are giving our creatives the tools to express what they want." To start, the "smarter paintbrushes" EA and Stability AI are building are concentrated on generating textures and in-game assets. EA hopes to create "Physically Based Rendering materials" with new tools "that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment." 

The company also describes using AI to "pre-visualize entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content." Stability AI is most famous for its powerful Stable Diffusion image generator, but the company maintains multiple tools for [generating 3D models](https://stability.ai/stable-3d), too, so the partnership is by no means out of place.

It helps that AI is on the tip of most video game executives' tongues. Strauss Zelnick, the head of Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two, [recently shared](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-ceo-predicts-genai-will-create-jobs-not-kill-them) that generative AI "will not reduce employment, it will increase employment," because "technology always increases productivity, which in turn increases GDP, which in turn increases employment." Krafton, the publisher of _PUBG: Battlegrounds_, made its commitment to AI even more clear, [announcing plans](https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/) on Thursday to become an AI-first company. Companies with a direct stake in the success of the AI industry, like Microsoft, have also created [gaming-focused tools](https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-windows-pcs-and-the-xbox-mobile-app-185452965.html) and [developed models](https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-trained-an-ai-model-on-a-game-no-one-played-160038242.html) for prototyping.

The motivations for EA might be even simpler, though. The company is in the midst of [being taken private](https://www.engadget.com/ea-confirms-it-will-go-private-in-55-billion-acquisition-133841614.html), and will soon be saddled with billions in debt. Theoretically cutting costs with AI might be one way the company hopes to survive the transition.
