Nintendo is in a giving state of mind this season, offering some [holiday deals](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/hits-for-the-holidays/#sort=df&p=2) on games in the eShop, including a few recent Switch 2 titles. For instance, the Switch 2 version of _Ball x Pit_, which was one of our staff's [favorite games of 2025](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html), is 20 percent off at $12. _Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles_ is $40, down from the usual $50 on Switch 2, which is about as good a deal as you’ll get for a current-year game release.

There are also a few older games that have gotten even steeper discounts. _Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition_ for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a whopping 75 percent off, so load it onto your new console for less than $18. At about $33, _Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Edition_ is half off for the original Switch. _No Man's Sky_ is also 50 percent off, so you can grab it for either Switch console for just $24. _Star Wars: Outlaws_ is down to $40, which is $20 off, and _Nier: Automata_ is $16, compared with its usual $40 price tag.

Those are just a few that caught our eye. The discounts will run until January 4, so you can make purchases as a last-minute gift or load up your own Switch in case nobody gifts you with a game you've been eyeing.
