The second season of _Battlefield 6_ is being pushed back based on “community feedback.” On Tuesday, EA and Battlefield Studios said Season 2 will now arrive on February 17.

Season 2 of _Battlefield 6_ had previously been scheduled for January 20, so we're looking at a delay of almost a month. As a consolation, the team is extending Season 1 through the start of the next season.

"During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2," EA wrote in a [blog post](https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update).

The game came out of the gates hot following its October launch, selling over [seven million copies over its first three days](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html). But recent Steam [reviews](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/) provide a glimpse into the "community feedback" that sparked the delay. "The Battle Pass is extremely predatory and very FOMO, while the season itself doesn't give a lot to offer," one [review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/SerryDartMan/recommended/2807960/) with over 450 “helpful” votes said. They called out the title for having "so much FOMO stuff that it becomes more stressful than fun."

The Season 1 extension will include some bonus content. The Frostfire Bonus Path will give “players the chance to unlock new free and premium customization rewards, including a Weapon Package and a Soldier Skin, as well as XP Boosts, by advancing through the tiers of the Frostfire Bonus Path." The extension update arrives on January 20.
