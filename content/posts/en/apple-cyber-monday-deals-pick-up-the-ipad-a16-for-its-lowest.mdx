Apple's entry-level [iPad A16](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DZ77D5HL&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d8f8e9c4-0be7-418f-a3a0-7efb153ec525&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=iPad+A16&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLWlQYWQtMTEtaW5jaC1EaXNwbGF5LUFsbC1EYXkvZHAvQjBEWjc3RDVITC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDhmOGU5YzQtMGJlNy00MThmLWEzYTAtN2VmYjE1M2VjNTI1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLWlQYWQtMTEtaW5jaC1EaXNwbGF5LUFsbC1EYXkvZHAvQjBEWjc3RDVITC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAVQL9d8hW4R04LN-b1l8PFE060T7En2GydT6-vdJ67jk&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day%2Fdp%2FB0DZ77D5HL%2F) is the perfect couch computer, and you can get one on sale for $274 for Cyber Monday. The model comes in a variety of colors and is the most affordable option in the company's lineup at its normal $349 price, and even more so now for 21 percent off.

The 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years.

The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable.

The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models.

Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility.

The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use.
