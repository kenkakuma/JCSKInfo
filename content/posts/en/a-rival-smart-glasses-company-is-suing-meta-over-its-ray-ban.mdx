Meta is being sued by [Solos](https://solosglasses.com/), a rival smart glasses maker, for infringing on its patents, [_Bloomberg_ reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/meta-essilorluxottica-sued-in-smart-glasses-patent-case). Solos is seeking "multiple billions of dollars" in damages and an injunction that could prevent Meta from selling its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses as part of the lawsuit.

Solos claims that Meta's [Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 1 smart glasses](https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html) violate multiple patents covering "core technologies in the field of smart eyewear." While less well known than Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica, Solos sells multiple pairs of glasses with similar features to what Meta offers. For example, the company's [AirGo A5 glasses](https://solosglasses.com/) lets you control music playback and automatically translate speech into different languages, and integrates ChatGPT for answering questions and searching the web.

Beyond the product similarities, Solos claims that Meta was able to copy its patents because Oakley (an EssilorLuxottica subsidiary) and Meta employees had insights into the company's products and road map. Solos says that in 2015, Oakley employees were introduced to the company's smart glasses tech, and were even given a pair of Solos glasses for testing in 2019. Solos also says that a MIT Sloan Fellow who researched the company's products and later became a product manager at Meta, brought knowledge of the company to her role. According to the logic of Solos' lawsuit, by the time Meta and EssilorLuxottica were selling their own smart glasses, "both sides had accumulated years of direct, senior-level and increasingly detailed knowledge of Solos' smart glasses technology."

Engadget has asked both Meta and EssilorLuxottica to comment on Solos' claims. We'll update this article if we hear back.

While fewer people own Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses than use Instagram, Meta considers the wearable one of its few hardware success stories. The company is so convinced it can make smart glasses happen that it [recently restructured its Reality Labs division](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html) to focus on AI hardware like smart glasses and hopefully build on its success.
