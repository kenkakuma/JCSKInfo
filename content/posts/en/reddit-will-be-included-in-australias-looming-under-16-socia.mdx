Reddit won't escape Australia's child social media ban. _The Guardian_ [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/04/reddit-included-australia-under-16-social-media-ban) that Communications Minister Anika Wells announced Reddit's addition on Wednesday. The nation's law, which [blocks children under 16 from major social media sites](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/australia-is-one-step-away-from-banning-social-media-for-under-16s-160454882.html), is scheduled to go into effect on December 10.

Alongside Reddit, Wells said Australian streaming site Kick would also be included. They join the previously announced Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Australia considers the list to be a starting point for the ban and won't rule out adding more.

YouTube was initially excluded because it was considered an educational tool. But after [protests from other companies](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html) on the list, [Australia ultimately added it](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-tiktok-argue-youtube-should-be-included-in-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-160220248.html).

The ban passed in late 2024. The legislation puts the onus on the platforms, rather than parents, to police underage use. Companies that don't take reasonable steps to prevent under-16 users from accessing their platforms can face penalties of up to AU$49.5 million (around $32 million).

"There's a time and place for social media in Australia, but there's not a place for predatory algorithms, harmful content and toxic popularity \[meters\] manipulating Australian children," Wells said. "Online platforms can target children with chilling control. We are mandating they use that sophisticated technology to protect them."

**Update, November 5 2025, 1:09PM ET:** A previous version of this story indicated that Australia was considering banning under 16s from using Discord, GitHub and Roblox. This is not the case, as Australian officials [do not plan to treat those](https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted) as age-restricted social media platforms. We regret the error.
