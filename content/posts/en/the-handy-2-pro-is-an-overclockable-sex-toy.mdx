**_The following article discusses adult themes._**

One surprising find at CES 2026 comes from OhDoki, the Norwegian makers of The Handy, a [smart stroking](https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-13-finally-a-good-digital-masturbator.html) device. It turned up to the desert with two new products, the Handy 2 and the Handy 2 Pro. Fundamentally, they’re the same device, but the Handy 2 Pro comes with a far bigger battery, taking the usable life from one hour on the standard model all the way to five. That extra power enables you to run the 2 Pro far faster and harder than the original once you set it into Turbo mode. In fact, I was told the hardware can essentially be “overclocked,” although I wouldn’t recommend it. Because the motor action was so aggressive that even just holding it in the hand, I’d be worried about breaking bones.

There are plenty of useful new features, including using the Handy’s beefy battery to charge your other USB-C devices. In addition, the sleeves are now be mounted to the motor arm with a click on motion, so you don’t have to wrestle with the (very) weighty hardware when you don’t have to. There are even tripod screws on both the side and bottom of the unit, enabling you to mount the Handy 2 to any compatible equipment. And, if you don’t want to use your phone to control the action, there’s a dot matrix display on the side which will show you both speed and stroke length.

Naturally, the company’s representatives were keen to highlight the connectivity features beyond just connecting to your own phone. As well as allowing other people to control the device, it’ll sync with various VR and video content platforms as well as tube sites like [Xhamster.](https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-12-porn-site-bans-all-north-carolina-users-anti-lgbt-law.html) And the company has recently teamed up with a cam platform for more remote opportunities for intimacy.

The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro launch January 6, with the regular model priced at $299 and the Pro going for $499.
