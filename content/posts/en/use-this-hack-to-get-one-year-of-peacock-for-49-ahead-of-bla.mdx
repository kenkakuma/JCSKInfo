If you've wanted to check out [_The Paper_](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/peacocks-the-office-spin-off-arrives-this-september-182859797.html) or any other new NBC show on Peacock, you can do so now while spending less thanks to this hack. Walmart, believe it or not, comes into play here: the retailer is offering [Walmart+](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=42662d87-a23a-43a7-8c38-b846b5d3d964&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Walmart&linkText=Walmart%2B&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9wbHVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MjY2MmQ4Ny1hMjNhLTQzYTctOGMzOC1iODQ2YjVkM2Q5NjQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL3BsdXMifQ&signature=AQAAAT6APRXBECJVxq4jsDYO2yMgUNCKXWsD_nDJjJrQ79h4&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus) subscriptions for half off right now, bringing the cost down to $49 for your first year. Thanks to a streaming benefit for subscribers, you can then sign up for Peacock at no extra cost.

Walmart+ subscribers are able to choose between a Peacock Premium or a Paramount+ Essential subscription. Considering Peacock premium would run you $110 for the year on its own, signing up for Walmart+ while this discount is available gets you access to the streaming service for less than half the normal cost.

Just about every major [streaming service](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html) has raised its prices in the last year, including [HBO Max](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/hbo-max-is-getting-even-more-expensive-starting-today-143939446.html), [Disney+](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-prices-are-increasing-in-october-yes-again-171830091.html), [Netflix](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-raises-subscription-praises-again-with-its-standard-plan-now-costing-18-per-month-234344714.html), [Apple TV](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-tv-subscriptions-just-rose-to-13-a-month-150516370.html) and [YouTube TV](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-completes-its-heel-turn-with-yet-another-price-hike-171518919.html), so saving some money on one of them just might be worth the effort. [Cord cutting](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html) is not nearly as affordable as it used to be, so finding a deal like this is pretty helpful.

Walmart+ itself offers myriad additional benefits like early access to Black Friday deals, free shipping on orders over $35, discounts on gas, free online veterinary care and more. Earlier this year, Walmart+ subscribers got [first dibs](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-is-coming-to-walmart-tonight-at-9pm-et--but-theres-a-catch-203129228.html) on the Nintendo Switch 2 at the retailer. You can also use that free shipping to take advantage of Walmart's [drone delivery](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/walmart-expands-drone-deliveries-to-five-new-cities-including-atlanta-200030301.html) program in a handful of select cities.
