Since last spring, OpenAI has [offered Codex](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=GOOG_M_SEM_GBR_Codex_TEM_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_CA_EN_111325&c_id=23224835927&c_agid=188410099575&c_crid=782256994950&c_kwid=%7Bkeywordid%7D&c_ims=&c_pms=9198201&c_nw=g&c_dvc=c&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23224835927&gclid=CjwKCAiAs4HMBhBJEiwACrfNZW4TMqMJP6cw8cNDyPyBXGdRLfqIKcHjOjnILLeSvLlD-2gFJ0i1_BoCZqoQAvD_BwE). What started life as the company's response to [Claude Code](https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html) is becoming [something more sophisticated](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/) with the release of a new dedicated macOS app. At its most basic form, Codex is a programming agent capable of writing code for users, but now it can also manage multiple AI assistants that can work together to complete more complex tasks.

OpenAI gives an example of how this could work in practice. The company used Codex to create a Mario Kart-like racing game, complete with a selection of different playable cars, eight tracks and a collection of powerups players can use against the competition. For a single AI agent, generating a game from scratch, with all the needed visual assets, would be a tough ask, but Codex was able to complete the task because it could delegate the work of making the game to different models with complementary capabilities. 

For example, it turned to [GPT Image](https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html) for the visual assets, while a separate model simultaneously coded the web game. "It took on the roles of designer, game developer and QA tester to validate its work by actually playing the game," OpenAI says of the process. 

If that sounds complicated, OpenAI has tried to make it more approachable with a section of the app titled Skills. The feature bundles “instructions, resources, and scripts so Codex can reliably connect to tools, run workflows, and complete tasks according to your team’s preferences," the company explains. "The Codex app includes a dedicated interface to create and manage skills. You can explicitly ask Codex to use specific skills, or let it automatically use them based on the task at hand."

As you might imagine, Codex can also automate repetitive tasks. A dedicated Automations section of the app allows you to schedule tasks, which the software will complete in the background. "At OpenAI, we’ve been using Automations to handle the repetitive but important tasks, like daily issue triage, finding and summarizing CI failures, generating daily release briefs, checking for bugs, and more," the company said. 

The release of the Codex macOS app comes as AI startups explore what a group of AI agents working in parallel can accomplish. At the start of the year, Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, [found](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) it was possible to build a working web browser from scratch using such an approach, though it did encounter problems along the way. 

For a limited time, OpenAI is making Codex available to ChatGPT Free and [Go users](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html) so they can see what's possible with this new software. At the same time, the company is doubling rates for Plus and Pro subscribers.
