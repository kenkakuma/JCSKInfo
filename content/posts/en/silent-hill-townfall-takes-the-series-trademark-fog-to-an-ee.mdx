Coming off the success of [_Slient Hill f_,](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-preview-gamescom-2025-123030305.html) which moved the series’ psychological horror to the Japanese countryside, Konami, Annapurna Interactive and developer Screen Burn Interactive have chosen a foggy island as the setting for [_Silent Hill: Townfall_.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvN3dP92wxU)

The first gameplay trailer for _Townfall_, introduced during Sony’s latest State of Play, follows Simon Ordell, a man who keeps mysteriously waking up in the water off the coast of the empty island town of St. Amelia. In the trailer, Simon hides from monsters, peers at a portable television, swings a fire axe, and deals with the psychological turmoil typical of a Silent Hill protagonist, all in first person, one of the unique twists of this new game.

_Silent Hill: Townfall_ was [originally announced](https://www.engadget.com/silent-hill-new-games-townfall-ascension-f-220813742.html) alongside _Silent Hill f_ and the remake of [_Silent Hill 2_](https://www.engadget.com/silent-hill-2-remake-hits-ps5-and-pc-on-october-8-230731258.html) in 2022. The game is developed by Screen Burn Interactive (formerly known as No Code), the creators of [_Observation_](https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-observation-ai-space-station-puzzle-game.html) and _Stories Untold_. Konami will share more details about _Townfall_’s gameplay and story in an upcoming [Silent Hill Transmission presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw) later today.

_Silent Hill: Townfall_ is coming to PlayStation 5 _in 2026._
