Samsung SmartTag 2 trackers are back on sale if you're willing to pick up a bundle. Woot has a four-pack [down to just $45](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8bcb408b-26bf-4ed1-b788-e3719aeef347&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=1748a861-e4e0-43a0-a739-cd7f741446f0&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Woot&linkText=down+to+just+%2445&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2VsZWN0cm9uaWNzLndvb3QuY29tL29mZmVycy80LXBhY2stc2Ftc3VuZy1zbWFydHRhZzItYmx1ZXRvb3RoLXRyYWNrZXJzLWdwcy1sb2NhdG9ycy0yNj8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NDhhODYxLWU0ZTAtNDNhMC1hNzM5LWNkN2Y3NDE0NDZmMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbGVjdHJvbmljcy53b290LmNvbS9vZmZlcnMvNC1wYWNrLXNhbXN1bmctc21hcnR0YWcyLWJsdWV0b290aC10cmFja2Vycy1ncHMtbG9jYXRvcnMtMjY_In0&signature=AQAAAeNHNH7ZsuKymUzcNr7MnNLI-tdb88KPtiusRo_rLV7M&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2F4-pack-samsung-smarttag2-bluetooth-trackers-gps-locators-26%3F), which undercuts the previous all-time low we’ve seen on Amazon ($55) by $10. That's a discount of 55 percent from the retail price of $100. It's a compelling opportunity to stock up if you're already in Samsung's ecosystem.

We named the SmartTag 2 the [best Bluetooth tracker](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html) for Samsung devices. The companion SmartThings Find app is easy to use, showing locations on a Google Maps-based interface. Much like Apple's Find My network, the location of a SmartTag is pinpointed using nearby Samsung phones. While nothing can beat the sheer size of Apple's tracking infrastructure given the number of iPhones in the US, it still worked well in our tests.

The SmartTag 2's design is more practical than some competitors since the oblong fob has a built-in hole that lets you easily attach your keys without buying an extra accessory. It’s IP67 rated for water and dust resistance, and uses a replaceable battery that Samsung says offers about 16 months of juice. The volume on the tag is pretty loud and users can select from multiple ringtones. Additionally, a double-squeeze of the SmartTag 2 will ping your handset, something you can't do with an AirTag.

The tracking is not quite as precise as Apple's AirTag, but it's a solid option for Samsung users looking to keep track of their things and can be scooped up at a bargain price.
