Amazon is in discussions with OpenAI to invest $10 billion in the company while supplying more of its AI chips and cloud computing services, according to [_The Financial Times_](https://www.ft.com/content/4217107e-2c98-4b78-9961-67d75237fac4). The deal would push OpenAI's valuation over $500 billion but is likely to raise more questions about the company's circular investment agreements involving chips and data centers. 

The two companies are also in talks about the possibility of OpenAI helping Amazon with its online marketplace, similar to deals it has made with Etsy, Shopify and Instacart. However, any agreement still wouldn't allow Amazon to market OpenAI's most advanced models on its developer cloud platform, as Microsoft holds the exclusive rights to those until the 2030s. 

OpenAI [recently restructured](https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal) its agreement with Microsoft to allow it to use data center capacity from other suppliers. Around the same time, it made a string of deals with [NVIDIA](https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal), Oracle, [AMD](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html) and others to build out data center capacity and acquire or rent AI chips. 

The new deal would require OpenAI to use Amazon's Trainium AI chips and rent more data center capacity from Amazon Web Services (AWS). That's on top of the $38 billion that OpenAI has already committed to renting servers from AWS over the next seven years. 

These deals have sounded alarms among investors considering their circular nature. In many of those, including this latest Amazon deal, OpenAI is taking investment money and then sending that cash back to the same company for infrastructure or chips. And the amounts are staggering, with just two companies, Softbank and Oracle, spending a combined $400 billion on new data centers for OpenAI's compute needs. And so far, OpenAI has lost more money than it makes.
