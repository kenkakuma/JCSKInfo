CES is the January trade show where the tech industry kicks off the year with a bevy of new and notable announcements — and it’s less than a week away. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.

More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the CTA’s schedule we also do know what companies will be hosting press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.

## The CES 2026 schedule

Press conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published [a searchable directory](https://exhibitors.ces.tech/8_0/#/) of who will have a presence at the show, along with [a schedule](https://www.ces.tech/schedule/) of every official panel and presentation.

On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with ["The First Look,"](https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look) a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's "vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences." Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics.

That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its ["Innovation in Tune with You"](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LG+Electronics&linkText=%22Innovation+in+Tune+with+You%22&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vc2cvYWJvdXQtbGcvcHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2xnLXRvLXNob3djYXNlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW4tdHVuZS13aXRoLXlvdS1hdC1jZXMtMjAyNi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2NDVhYjQwLTIwYjEtNGNmMC1iZGNmLTllOTY1NmM3OTA2MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3NnL2Fib3V0LWxnL3ByZXNzLWFuZC1tZWRpYS9sZy10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLXR1bmUtd2l0aC15b3UtYXQtY2VzLTIwMjYvIn0&signature=AQAAAVdFbvagfuLjdXSTGikLKfxv5Lxz8K374JXMuW2mYP05&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fsg%2Fabout-lg%2Fpress-and-media%2Flg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026%2F) presentation to share "its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence" at the start of the day, Intel is [launching](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html) its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, [Sony Honda Mobility](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html) is holding a [press conference](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/) offering yet more details on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at [a keynote](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/ces.html) address that closes out the day.

On the week of December 15, the CTA added a [keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to its schedule](https://www.ces.tech/schedule/nvidia-press-conference-at-ces-2026-with-founder-and-ceo-jensen-huang/). The event will take place on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.”

Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's [Tech World Conference](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&featureId=text-link&linkText=Tech+World+Conference&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MubGVub3ZvLmNvbS9wcmVzc3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbGVub3ZvLWFubm91bmNlcy10ZWNod29ybGQtY2VzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjY0NWFiNDAtMjBiMS00Y2YwLWJkY2YtOWU5NjU2Yzc5MDYxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MubGVub3ZvLmNvbS9wcmVzc3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbGVub3ZvLWFubm91bmNlcy10ZWNod29ybGQtY2VzLyJ9&signature=AQAAAV2t1hmM6cxHwm-5E40pl-6ZqrWVm-ixaEoZVVfhOmeh&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.lenovo.com%2Fpressroom%2Fpress-releases%2Flenovo-announces-techworld-ces%2F) at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's "commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower." It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well.

## Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicity

As they typically do, some companies have already gotten a head start on the CES news by publicly sharing their announcements in the weeks leading up to January. LG, for example, has said it will [debut its first Micro RGB television at CES](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html). While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of [5K-capable gaming monitors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html) on deck with built-in AI upscaling.

But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a [Dolby-powered modular home audio system](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html) and flex its automation muscles with a humanoid [home automation robot named CLOiD](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html).

Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung [will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html), for starters. The company already introduced its [first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html), which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology.

Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a [6K model](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html) that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line.

And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the [Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html)

Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.

## New chips from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm

CES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted [Ryzen 7 9850X3D](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mentions-unreleased-gaming-optimized-ryzen-7-9850x3d-could-be-the-next-fastest-gaming-cpu-ever), which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the [Ryzen 9000G](https://www.pcguide.com/cpu/amd-ryzen-9000g-release-date-specs-price/) series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new [FSR Redstone](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-will-preview-its-redstone-upscaling-tech-on-december-10-174507324.html) AI upscaling tech.

Intel has already [publicly announced](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/ces.html) that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall "AI PC" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on [a preview](https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-its-panther-lake-core-ultra-chips-130010879.html) from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its [2-nanometer 18A process](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intels-next-gen-manufacturing-process-is-reportedly-still-struggling-184146350.html) will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.

Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done [moving its Snapdragon chips](https://www.engadget.com/here-are-all-of-the-copilot-pcs-with-snapdragon-x-chips-that-were-released-today-104404765.html) out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's [Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium](https://www.engadget.com/computing/qualcomm-says-its-new-snapdragon-chips-are-the-fastest-and-most-efficient-for-windows-pcs-084535090.html) chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.

## Brighter, "truer" screens

As noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.

Sony announced [a collection of new Bravia TVs](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sonys-2025-bravia-tv-lineup-includes-a-new-flagship-qd-oled-model-160019669.html) in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new [RGB LED panel](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=205f44ce-77be-4119-a5db-84e810a586b7&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Sony-UK&linkText=RGB+LED+panel&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb255LmNvLnVrL3ByZXNzY2VudHJlL3NvbnktZGV2ZWxvcHMtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWRpc3BsYXktc3lzdGVtLXdpdGgtcHJvcHJpZXRhcnktc2lnbmFsLXByb2Nlc3NpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9neS1mb3ItaW5kaXZpZHVhbC1yZ2ItY29udHJvbC1vZi1oaWdoLWRlbnNpdHktbGVkLWJhY2tsaWdodHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2NDVhYjQwLTIwYjEtNGNmMC1iZGNmLTllOTY1NmM3OTA2MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ueS5jby51ay9wcmVzc2NlbnRyZS9zb255LWRldmVsb3BzLW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1kaXNwbGF5LXN5c3RlbS13aXRoLXByb3ByaWV0YXJ5LXNpZ25hbC1wcm9jZXNzaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZm9yLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtcmdiLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtaGlnaC1kZW5zaXR5LWxlZC1iYWNrbGlnaHRzIn0&signature=AQAAAQjl0CHSLu-e4f5LhX9rq454peFeTRK2L4mGcS8iLZ0l&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.co.uk%2Fpresscentre%2Fsony-develops-next-generation-display-system-with-proprietary-signal-processing-technology-for-individual-rgb-control-of-high-density-led-backlights) that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's "General RGB LED Backlight Technology" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. 

The company has already trademarked the name ["True RGB,"](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1764577431) which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have [a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1764577431) coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.

Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new [HDR10+ Advanced standard](https://www.ces.tech/schedule/) would be Samsung's answer to [Dolby Vision 2](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/dolby-announces-dolby-vision-2-expanding-picture-quality-beyond-hdr-123019504.html), which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.

And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: [Displace](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-displace-hub-can-make-your-normal-tv-wireless-193837460.html) will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.

## Ballie Watch 2026

The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as "Ballie" has been announced twice, [first in 2020](https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-samsung-ballie-robot-face-on-hands-on-interview.html) and then [again in 2024](https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-samsung-ballie-robot-face-on-hands-on-interview.html) with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would [go on sale in 2025](https://www.engadget.com/home/the-cute-samsung-ballie-home-robot-will-actually-go-on-sale-this-year-223528677.html) at CES last year and then [shared in April 2025](https://www.engadget.com/home/the-cute-samsung-ballie-home-robot-will-actually-go-on-sale-this-year-223528677.html) that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.

[Robot vacuums and mops](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/the-new-robot-vacuums-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2025-210358124.html) were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the [Roborock Saros Z70](https://www.engadget.com/home/roborocks-new-flagship-robot-vacuum-has-an-arm-that-can-grab-small-objects-170020390.html), but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the [Dreame X50](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html) seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock [Qrevo Curv 2 Flow](https://global.roborock.com/pages/roborock-qrevo-curv-2-flow), the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.

Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. [Prominent members](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2645ab40-20b1-4cf0-bdcf-9e9656c79061&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&linkText=Prominent+members&custData=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&signature=AQAAAYqkRUE2z5IDV26S35rqiGSTwNJjYA5_Sa9dk5s72igu&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fai%2Fyann-lecun-ai-meta-0058b13c%3Fgaa_at%3Deafs%26gaa_n%3DAWEtsqelSo5VFKvYtDCq4ld3WerBkmf4fKsLcai9zgeylSadD3wz-x-9t7x4%26gaa_ts%3D6931c128%26gaa_sig%3DrD1ErfmKH00kAzc1TBu0uD9tVv83N-f0qSi4uhzuVwag0bNJuPrTZhlW8gOjtaY7oWIVHfJPzIINicCQsolFxQ%253D%253D) of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to [world models](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/what-are-ai-world-models-and-why-do-they-matter/), which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.
