America’s once-promising EV transition may have [taken a U-turn](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trump-administration-stops-nationwide-ev-charging-program-172002768.html), but at least some in Hollywood are trying to do their part. Rivian partnered with _Grey’s Anatomy_ to make a custom electric ambulance for the long-running series.

The ambulance is a modified version of [Rivian’s Commercial Van](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-van-nationwide-152713164.html). The custom “vanbulance” serves a dual purpose: preventing on-set exhaust fumes (which could harm the cast and crew) and integrating a green storyline. “As an added benefit, the elimination of engine noise brought a welcome quiet while cameras were rolling,” Rivan wrote in a [blog post](https://stories.rivian.com/greys-anatomy-vanbulance-rivian-commercial-van).

Among other modifications, it has rear double doors instead of a roll-up one.

The vehicle includes some production-specific touches. Its walls and roof panels are removable, allowing cameras to reach angles required for interior shots. In addition, Rivian replaced the standard van’s rear roll-up door with double doors while adding a side entry to the cargo area. The company also added custom lighting and an exterior wrap reading “Seattle Emergency Response Services.”

The team consulted with the Huntington Beach Fire Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department to inform the interior layout. “Their feedback was invaluable to understand how first responders actually use their vehicles,” Rivian wrote.

At least Hollywood's fictional worlds are transitioning to electric.

_The Hollywood Reporter_ [notes](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/greys-anatomy-electric-ambulance-season-22-1236488768/) that the electric ambulance debuted in the November 13, 2025, episode of _Grey’s Anatomy_. However, it was featured more prominently in Thursday’s episode — hence Rivian choosing this week to highlight it.
