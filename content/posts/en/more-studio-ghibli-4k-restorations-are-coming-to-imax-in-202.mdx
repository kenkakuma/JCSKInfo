IMAX and animation distributor GKids are bringing more 4K Studio Ghibli restorations to the largest screens in 2026. The [announcement](https://www.imax.com/en/gb/pr/gkids-and-imaxr-announce-new-studio-ghibli-4k-restorations-debut) follows the IMAX release of _Princess Mononoke_ this year, with the ongoing restorations being directly supervised by Studio Ghibli’s Atsushi Okui, who’s been with the company since 1993.

Okui was the Director of Digital Imaging on 2023’s [_The Boy and the Heron_](https://www.engadget.com/studio-ghiblis-the-boy-and-the-heron-arrives-on-max-in-september-140046955.html), which was also the first Ghibli picture to get the [IMAX](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/cinemark-is-adding-more-70mm-imax-screens-ahead-of-christopher-nolans-the-odyssey-194155824.html) treatment. The likes of _My Neighbour Totoro_ and _Spirited Away_ have also had theatrical re-releases in recent years. GKids heads up distribution in North America for the Japanese animation giant’s films across all platforms, and has been working with IMAX on various projects since 2021.

It sounds like the remaining Ghibli titles set for theatrical IMAX releases in the US will arrive one at a time, and GKids is not saying how many we can expect, or what it’s following _Princess Mononoke_ with next year. I did a quick check for notable upcoming anniversaries, and 2026 does mark 40 years of _Castle in the Sky_, but one of the studio’s newer films might be a more obvious guess for a 4K refurb. Time will tell.
