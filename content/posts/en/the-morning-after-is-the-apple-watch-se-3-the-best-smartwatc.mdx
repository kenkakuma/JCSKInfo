Apple’s entry-level smartwatch has improved so much it delivers an experience comparable to pricier Apple Watches. The most important upgrades [in the SE 3](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-se-3-review-good-enough-for-most-people-133000008.html) are the always-on display, faster charging speeds and on-device Siri. This brings a lot of parity to other Apple Watch devices in the most crucial areas.

It doesn’t have everything: The SE 3’s optical sensor is older and lacks the capabilities of Series 10 and 11 smartwatches, which feature electrical heart rate sensors. You’ll still get notifications for irregular rhythms and low cardio fitness as well as high and low heart rate notifications. All of this for $259? (Or [$200 if you’re quick](https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-apple-watch-se-3-drops-to-200-before-black-friday-133057187.html).) It’s the most tempting first step into Apple’s wearable yet. It might be time for me to upgrade from my Series 8.

## [Nintendo announces its Black Friday deals](https://www.engadget.com/deals/nintendo-announces-its-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025-sale-switch-2-bundles-switch-game-deals-and-more-155223898.html)

### Switch 2 bundles, Switch game deals and more.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025, and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during Black Friday, you may be disappointed. However, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come as console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with _Mario Kart World_ for $499. Both options are still available, but there’s a new bundle to consider as well, the console with the new _Pokémon Legends: Z-A_ game, which also costs $499.

The [Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/au/hardware/nintendo-switch-2/featured-games/) will have cyber deals on games November 20 through December 3. The shop will feature “holiday offers on select games,” but we don’t know which games they will be. Meanwhile, other retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games, including _Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3_ and _Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe_. Those will each be $40, while other games like _Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ and _Splatoon 3_ will be $30.

### Get those steps in even easier.

Kojima Productions has a new collaboration for anyone who wishes to enhance their lower-body strength and stability — or simply prepare for cosplay in 2026. The studio has teamed up with exoskeleton maker Dnsys for a limited run of a model based on _Death Stranding 2: On The Beach._ It’s said to mimic the game’s load-balancing system by offloading up to 200 percent of the wearer’s body weight from their knees to help protect the joints. Dnsys said it adds 50 percent more power to steps and “intelligent gait control” to improve balance on stairs and uneven terrain.

## [Renders show off Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26+](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/renders-show-off-samsungs-upcoming-galaxy-s26-194014359.html)

### Maybe no S25 Edge successor.

According to a report from _Android Headlines_, Samsung may stick with its Plus models of Galaxy phone — and ditch the [just-got-here Edge line](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html). A leaker has given us a glimpse at the forthcoming S26+, and it looks similar to the company’s other smartphones. The small, raised camera island has been tweaked a bit, and the report suggests the S26+ will be 7.35mm thick, which is in line with the S25+. It also seems to be decidedly chunkier than the S25 Edge, so this is likely not a swap: The next Plus device won’t be the Edge.
