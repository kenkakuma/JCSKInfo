Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As ever, it's been a busy week of new games arriving and details of upcoming releases emerging. Before we get to some of those though, the nominees for the second annual [Indie Game Awards](https://www.indiegameawards.gg/) were announced this week.

There's a nice mix of big hitters and smaller, but equally worthy titles among the Game of the Year contenders. Those are:

*   _Absolum_ \- Dotemu, Guard Crush Games and Supamonks
    
*   _and Roger_ - TearyHand Studio
    
*   _Blue Prince_ - Dogubomb
    
*   _Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector_ - Jump Over the Age
    
*   _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ - Sandfall Interactive
    
*   _Consume Me_ - Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P and Ken "coda" Snyder
    
*   _Hades II_ - Supergiant Games
    
*   _Hollow Knight: Silksong_ - Team Cherry
    
*   _Keep Driving_ - YCJY Games
    
*   _Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo_ - Pocket Trap
    

_Consume Me_ and _and Roger_ are two I've been meaning to check out for a while. I'm also yet to hop into _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33,_ which is arguably the frontrunner here — it's looking like the favorite for top honors at The Game Awards next month as well. 

There are a whole bunch of worthy contenders in other categories, from hits like [_Discounty_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-cozy-management-sim-discounty-arrives-on-august-21-170037206.html) and the charmingly bittersweet [_Time Flies_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-terrific-2d-ninja-gaiden-housefly-bucket-lists-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110005806.html), to solo-developed projects like [_Spilled!_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ports-a-plenty-a-zen-garden-creator-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000091.html) and [_Vile: Exhumed_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/banned-steam-game-vile-exhumed-is-back-as-a-free-shareware-title-225220847.html). The supremely addictive [_Ball x Pit_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html) picked up a nod, but it's going against the tremendous [_Öoo_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html) (and _Absolum_, _Hades II_ and _Silksong_) in the gameplay design category. It's neat to see Playdate game [_Taria & Como_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-2-review-taria--como-and-black-hole-havoc-210042109.html) earn recognition too.

The Indie Game Awards ceremony takes place on December 18 at 6:30PM ET. You can watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SixOneIndie) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sixoneindie). 

## New releases

The new release I'm most looking forward to trying when I have a chance is _Windswept_, a precision platformer that's inspired by similar games from the '90s like _Donkey Kong Country_. Marbles the duck and Checkers the turtle each have unique movement abilities, and you'll need to swap between the pair to best navigate environments. You'll be trying to help them get back home after a storm whisked them away.

There are lots of secrets to discover across the 40-plus levels, animal buddies to ride and much more. I grew up with games like this one from WeatherFell and publisher Top Hat Studios, which looks completely up my alley. _Windswept_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660960/Windswept/'), [GOG](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=04d3e9f1-3fb3-4cc9-afc0-c780224b2cdf&featureId=text-link&merchantName=GOG.com&linkText=GOG&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvd2luZHN3ZXB0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNGQzZTlmMS0zZmIzLTRjYzktYWZjMC1jNzgwMjI0YjJjZGYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZy5jb20vZW4vZ2FtZS93aW5kc3dlcHQifQ&signature=AQAAAfQrN-uUphdtDXjzNi0aQPbfyXbK0D5iuSo4JkTHV4Eg&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwindswept), [Nintendo Switch](https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu8-2FmeXSTt1z6eXo68IDEqINZV-2BfHMfa-2F-2BI6xl9GnMUR7htjGE0Qf9EICttH9v0cpUV4W7v1Vy-2BgabeHZ-2FLBzaqPQ-3D3OFA_UCE4dJ2Y3UOdbO0wjXc8y97zAttE4HNfZRZxsWULju-2BHAPLSfS77fFUtTSvcsQhVWziI-2BOknXdVeqPtePPcDCW-2BBtey83orMBHznZp-2FhZjGCiSqYmJ-2BXvtkM0Zxs1SIpjiIbmAl-2BeP4-2F-2B-2FN0LBXcLbB2q1nOK7Fm9-2FUogbddEhqbUBCM4lbEP1yL2kG2a6d0EID330dbSncY-2FVu-2BtfYQEc-2BQ0BylLqQUQlhqtTIMA3FqyWdBQ43FwVn6ckZGbOIZmx-2FN6B1gDPSpWBvMAWGa-2B7o8SBMJaa28PwMuTFqr-2BYnmkN1uv2i7Y4oecY-2BZ2zG-2BR33G9OCwA-2BOE6ofe3nkyUMG0aFoGToZnmoODYG-2BsrEDxmQPR51C2wJ1zASLRuSqUXoThL8K1uQIxmzbVqBpMXdtLs-2FVjyFIKppuIk5J3WsERORXzp9rWYfEaUbFBAsvBo3wtmmNAGKGpvJjPo4v-2FYukBY-2BaSbmWuvWwZqLix9cdDbK-2BZ1mY5KiEBA4YmFUyG-2BN7GlWqWobDdrNkhucUgPA-3D-3D), [PS4, PS5](https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu82-2FZaHDPXczNtkXnOrUd1Rb6tqYOyiRY3hWHkAtaltO00IFmvdvcI8JVVMGp2c8qYA-3D-3DxivP_UCE4dJ2Y3UOdbO0wjXc8y97zAttE4HNfZRZxsWULju-2BHAPLSfS77fFUtTSvcsQhVWziI-2BOknXdVeqPtePPcDCW-2BBtey83orMBHznZp-2FhZjGCiSqYmJ-2BXvtkM0Zxs1SIpjiIbmAl-2BeP4-2F-2B-2FN0LBXcLbB2q1nOK7Fm9-2FUogbddEhqbUBCM4lbEP1yL2kG2a6d0EID330dbSncY-2FVu-2BtfYQEc-2BQ0BylLqQUQlhqtTIMA3FqyWdBQ43FwVn6ckZGbOIZmx-2FN6B1gDPSpWBvMAWGa-2B7o8SBMJaa28PwMuTFqr-2BYnmkN1uv2i7Y4oecY-2BZ2zG-2BR33G9OCwA-2BOE6ofe3nkyUMG0aFoGToZnmoODYG-2BsrEDxmQPR51C2wJ1zASLRuSqUPT-2FVnPUMIqRSyOt4q-2BU6wbzqObF9TvMzs7uK7PZ5wITJ8iNtBRsr-2FS7-2BvTe45vuL9PlG1RPG993idUhejJfhIh5nd48VAtmyCch57dPFYlJKKMHa-2BiSu4yukUouXtqlgj7iwunX02HdVD51RrxfRRw-3D-3D), [Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S](https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu840gOg2poI6qc7nnA1nivsvIN3WhjQvuaiu-2BPNF5EU0SucUX2EV0in-2Fc-2F4K-2BPKCE-2FP8-2FX0IS4oYb5b1o2sykL1g-3DVjBS_UCE4dJ2Y3UOdbO0wjXc8y97zAttE4HNfZRZxsWULju-2BHAPLSfS77fFUtTSvcsQhVWziI-2BOknXdVeqPtePPcDCW-2BBtey83orMBHznZp-2FhZjGCiSqYmJ-2BXvtkM0Zxs1SIpjiIbmAl-2BeP4-2F-2B-2FN0LBXcLbB2q1nOK7Fm9-2FUogbddEhqbUBCM4lbEP1yL2kG2a6d0EID330dbSncY-2FVu-2BtfYQEc-2BQ0BylLqQUQlhqtTIMA3FqyWdBQ43FwVn6ckZGbOIZmx-2FN6B1gDPSpWBvMAWGa-2B7o8SBMJaa28PwMuTFqr-2BYnmkN1uv2i7Y4oecY-2BZ2zG-2BR33G9OCwA-2BOE6ofe3nkyUMG0aFoGToZnmoODYG-2BsrEDxmQPR51C2wJ1zASLRuSqUhV-2FK9Hyi1meZW0sAXf0e6lMxXMhGwQcgALY3Ax6tjwdpJk5SPVGwapwvO-2F-2Frr4s4uACFo7HmQfzDxi7nF9Yp2NHEjBjuq5rdf3E8AfYt8eSDUoaI5znYFl40LwLkgQBYCeoyLR09YNyy9HxDmZaYOQ-3D-3D) for $20.

The Devolver Digital-published [_Possessor(s)_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/horror-tinged-sidescroller-possessors-hits-pc-and-ps5-on-november-11-152851427.html) is something a little different from _Hyper Light Drifter_ studio Heart Machine. This is a horror-inflected Metroidvania and the developers drew inspiration from platform fighters for the combat. Here, high school student Luca forms an alliance with a demon in need of a host following "an interdimensional catastrophe." They team up to stay alive and discover what led to the disaster.

As with Heart Machine's other games, it looks very pretty, but reviews for _Possessor(s)_ — which is out on [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011670) and [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132890/Possessors/) — have been fairly mixed so far. Things haven't exactly been going great for Heart Machine overall. The studio last month [laid off staff](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyper-light-breaker-studio-will-end-the-games-development-and-lay-off-staff-162941243.html) and ended development of _Hyper Light Breaker_, which remains in early access. 

As with its earlier game _Before Your Eyes_, Nice Dream says its latest project, _Goodnight Universe_, is best played with a camera. There's the option to interact with the game using your eye movement and facial expressions. That makes a lot of sense for _Goodnight Universe_, which casts you in the role of a six-month-old baby with psychic powers. Little Isaac just wants familial love, but a shadowy tech corporation is looking to take custody of him.

Skybound Games is the publisher of _Goodnight Universe_, which is available on [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/goodnight-universe-switch-2/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014923), [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=04d3e9f1-3fb3-4cc9-afc0-c780224b2cdf&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1DQS9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9nb29kbmlnaHQtdW5pdmVyc2UvOU5UMzVGV05CNVBDIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNGQzZTlmMS0zZmIzLTRjYzktYWZjMC1jNzgwMjI0YjJjZGYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLUNBL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2dvb2RuaWdodC11bml2ZXJzZS85TlQzNUZXTkI1UEMifQ&signature=AQAAAdL_AK5bh7xxOa55WmGtbQ2JkuEYg4tgK2_MXIY9dOTl&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fgoodnight-universe%2F9NT35FWNB5PC) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416100/Goodnight_Universe/) for $20. A Switch version is coming on December 18, and an update that will bring camera support to the Switch 2 edition is on the way.

_Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution_ is a turn-based strategy game that affords you the chance to shift the outcome of the French Revolution. An opportunity to revolutionize the revolution, as it were. You can defend, depose or even reform the monarchy. 

As the title suggests, you'll have mechs at your disposal in battle — to that end, this reminds me a bit of the clockpunk soulslike _Steelrising_, which was also set during the French Revolution. _Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution,_ from Studio Imugi and co-publisher 2P Games, left early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560340/Bonaparte__A_Mechanized_Revolution/) this week. It costs $20.

## Upcoming 

I'm very happy to continue this little run of including a dog game in this roundup every week with something new on the beautifully titled [_Barkour_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/). As part of [Steam Animal Fest](https://store.steampowered.com/category/animal) (which runs until Monday and includes a sale on games like _Tunic_ and _Hello Kitty Island Adventure_), Varsav Game Studios unleashed a new trailer and an updated [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/) demo. 

Here, you play as Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R., a special agent with gadgets galore and plenty of bite to go with the bark. On missions, you can play the stealthy way, fight your enemies head on or carry out barkour parkour runs. Varsav Game Studios is hoping to release _Barkour_ in 2026.

Next up, we have release dates for a pair of cafe sims, starting with _Tailside_. As a furry cafe owner, you'll be looking to perfect the art of coffee making so you can serve delicious concoctions to your patrons. You can even create foam art on lattes for an extra-special touch.

In this game from solo developer Coffee Beans Dev, you can customize your cafe to your liking. There are no timers to worry about, so you can play at your own pace. _Tailside_ is coming to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/) on January 21. A demo is available now.

As revealed during the [State of Play Japan showcase](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-state-of-play-japan-tomorrow-140519040.html) this week, the latest entry in the Coffee Talk series is bound for [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3161220/Coffee_Talk_Tokyo/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012616), [Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=04d3e9f1-3fb3-4cc9-afc0-c780224b2cdf&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+One%2C+Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9jb2ZmZWUtdGFsay10b2t5by85bm4zbGtmMzhmcjQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA0ZDNlOWYxLTNmYjMtNGNjOS1hZmMwLWM3ODAyMjRiMmNkZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvY29mZmVlLXRhbGstdG9reW8vOW5uM2xrZjM4ZnI0In0&signature=AQAAAe09CkpmfcR1zntOU9-oi4NDvX7hfO1N3kVZ-VQndzvG&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fcoffee-talk-tokyo%2F9nn3lkf38fr4) and Nintendo Switch on March 5. Chorus Worldwide Games and Toge Productions' _Coffee Talk Tokyo_ places you in the role of a barista who hears out their clientele.

The drinks you make (which you can enhance with sprinkle stencils for latte art) help shape your conversations with customers and have a bearing on the branching storylines. _Coffee Talk_ and _Coffee Talk Episode 2_ composer Andrew “AJ” Jeremy returned to craft another lo-fi soundtrack for the latest installment.

A release window for _InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories_ was confirmed during the State of Play Tokyo stream as well. It's coming to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2723430/inKONBINI_One_Store_Many_Stories/) and consoles, including [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011644), in April. There's a Steam demo available now. 

From Nagai Industries, this simulator puts you in the role of a college student and employee of a small-town Japanese convenience store (a konbini) in the early 1990s. You'll decide which products to sell, and order and restock goods. More importantly, you'll have to deliver exceptional customer service. That involves having conversations with customers, which will sometimes end up having an impact on their lives. It seems quite lovely.
