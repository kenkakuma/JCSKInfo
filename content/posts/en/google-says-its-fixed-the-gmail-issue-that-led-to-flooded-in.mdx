Your Gmail inbox should now be back to normal after Saturday’s hiccups. Google said in an update on X on Saturday night that the issue, which affected the automatic filters that keep Gmail users’ inboxes free from the clutter of promotional emails, non-urgent updates and spam, “is now fully resolved for all users.” On its [Workspace status dashboard](https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/incidents/NNnDkY9CJ36annsfytjQ), it added that an investigation is underway, and an analysis will be published once complete.

Gmail users on Saturday reported that their inboxes were flooded with promotional emails that had not been properly sorted out of the main tab, and some said they were seeing notices that emails had not been scanned for spam. On social media and [DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/), some Gmail users also reported delays in receiving messages, leading to issues with two-factor authentication logins. After confirming the issue, Google noted in an update on its Workspace dashboard that the problem resulted in the "misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings," including a banner that says, “Be careful with this message. Gmail hasn't scanned this message for spam, unverified senders, or harmful software.”

In a statement to Engadget, a Google spokesperson echoed the message from its dashboard, saying, "We are actively working to resolve the issue. As always, we encourage users to follow standard best practices when engaging with messages from unknown senders."

**Update, January 25 2026, 9:53AM ET:** This story has been updated to reflect that the issue has been resolved.
