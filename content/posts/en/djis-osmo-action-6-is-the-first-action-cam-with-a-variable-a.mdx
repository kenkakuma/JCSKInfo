DJI has released its third action cam in [less than](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-nano-review-high-quality-video-in-a-truly-tiny-action-cam-120040319.html) four months, the Osmo Action 6. The new GoPro rival offers something we've never seen in this type of camera: a variable aperture for more control over exposure. It also has a new, square sensor (like the one we saw on the [Osmo 360](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html)) that makes it easier to crop video for social media-friendly aspect ratios. I've had the Osmo Action 6 for a few days and it looks impressive so far.

Rather than a fixed f/2.8 setting as before, the Osmo Action 6 offers a variable f/2.0-4.0 aperture, which offers several benefits. When at f/2.0, it allows twice as much light as before. That in turn allows for higher shutter speeds in dim conditions, which reduces the motion blur that can hurt image quality and stabilization. It also delivers shallower depth of field to help separate the subject from the background. On sunny days, meanwhile, changing the aperture to f/4.0 lets you _lower_ the shutter speed so video looks less staccato and more natural.

Oddly, DJI doesn't let you fully control the f-stop, however. You can either choose a fixed aperture at f/2.8, or Auto aperture with a range of ISOs, varying from f/2.0 - 4.0 up to f/2.8 - 4.0. That's unfortunate, as it would be nice to be able to select a fixed f/2.0 aperture, for example, to have a shallow depth of field for portraits. (Note that you can pick an f/4.0 fixed aperture as well to get a "starburst" pattern on bright parts of the image.)

The Action 6 has a new, 1/1.1-inch square sensor (9.8 x 9.8mm), as well. It doesn't boost resolution as some people had [hoped](https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/1ow97r7/contrary_to_rumours_the_osmo_action_6_doesnt/), but does allow for more aspect ratio choices. As with the Action 5, video can be shot at up to 4K 120 fps, or 4K at 60 fps in SuperNight Mode. However, it now offers a 4K Custom mode that lets you capture 3,840 x 3,840 square video at up to 60 fps, for cropping at full 4K resolution in both horizontal and vertical formats. It also supports 4:3 4K (3,840 x 2,880) at up to 120 fps for more cropping options when shooting slo-mo.

The new sensor is also considerably larger than the 1/1.3-inch sensor on the Osmo Action 5 and the 1/1.9-inch sensor on the GoPro 13. That allows for improved low-light performance, according to DJI, and the larger pixels also boost dynamic range to a claimed 13.5 stops. That, combined with DJI's D-LogM and 10-bit capability, should make footage from the Osmo Action 6 easy to adjust, even on high contrast sunny days.

DJI has also taken a page from Fujifilm by introducing a Film Tone function to get six distinct looks straight out of the camera, including "cool tones," "classic negative film" and "pleasing skin tones." The Osmo Action 6 also offers a 2x lossless zoom (a digital zoom, effectively), portrait mode and subject centering and tracking. Finally, the new "Natural Wide" mode gives you a wider field of view without the usual ugly distortion at the corners. 

For closeup photography, the Action 6 is available with an optional macro lens, as well as an FOV Boost lens that increases the field of view from 155 to 182 degrees.

From my tests so far, low-light video quality looks considerably cleaner and more color-accurate than the Action 5. In addition, the SuperNight Mode is more useful as shutter speeds are higher and thus stabilization in low light is improved over the Action 5. I'll have more information in my full review, coming soon. 

There are a number of other improvements as well. DJI has boosted the internal storage to 50GB from 47GB before, so you can largely shoot without a memory card, though a microSD slot is also available. As before, it's waterproof to 20 meters (66 feet) by itself, or nearly 200 feet with DJI's waterproof case. And on top of voice control, the Action 6 now supports gestures as well. With the same 1,950mAh Extreme Battery Plus as before, shooting time between charges is 4 hours at 1080p and 2 hours at 4K, both with Rocksteady 3.0 stabilization enabled and the screen off.

DJI

The Osmo Action 6 is compatible with DJI's increasingly generous accessory lineup, like selfie sticks, bike, helmet and body attachments, suction mounts and more. However, the company upgraded its Quick-Release Adapter Mount to a dual-latch system (first introduced on the Osmo Nano) that "can be attached in either direction without mechanical limitations," the company said. That's a big quality-of-life improvement over the old mounts, which could only be attached one way. That said, the old mounts are still compatible with the new camera and vice-versa. 

So what about US availability? It looks like, as with the Osmo 360 and Osmo Nano, that DJI's Action 6 won't be available on the company's US store, but it will be sold at Amazon, B&H Photo Video and other third-party resellers, with pricing tba. In Europe, the Osmo Action 6 is now available at [DJI's store](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=cb41ef03-1ad2-4c66-aa8c-e41e32bd0e16&featureId=text-link&merchantName=DJI&linkText=DJI%27s+store&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmRqaS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjYjQxZWYwMy0xYWQyLTRjNjYtYWE4Yy1lNDFlMzJiZDBlMTYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RvcmUuZGppLmNvbS8ifQ&signature=AQAAAWKeZwbVZ18Px-lGZHy2y92Ex-CUWHf4v8GFmJGHqDpJ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2F) and Amazon at €379 for the standard combo with one battery, or €479 in the Adventure Combo that includes three batteries and the Battery Case 3 charger.
