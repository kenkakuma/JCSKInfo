Basketball fans can save on [NBA League Pass](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c109eac4-825f-483e-8edf-51532ca9e7cb&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a364f8fe-4cef-4bc2-89cf-730e7b34af39&featureId=text-link&merchantName=National+Basketball+Association&linkText=NBA+League+Pass&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmEuY29tL2xlYWd1ZS1wYXNzLXB1cmNoYXNlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMzY0ZjhmZS00Y2VmLTRiYzItODljZi03MzBlN2IzNGFmMzkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbGVhZ3VlLXBhc3MtcHVyY2hhc2UifQ&signature=AQAAAdUhKaPYHJzinvfA7MLKAWA2Ghk-P2COLZr_GV2bgBXf&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fleague-pass-purchase) right now, which lets you catch a bunch of out-of-market NBA games via streaming. The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from the usual $160, and League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. Considering we're almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year.

The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once.

Last year, League Pass [added multiview](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/nba-league-pass-gets-multiview-just-in-time-for-the-season-to-start-191016755.html), which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game.

Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.

If you're an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US. Subscribers can get a list of applicable blackouts by entering their ZIP code before signing up.
