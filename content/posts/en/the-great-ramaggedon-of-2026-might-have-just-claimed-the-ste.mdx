Less than a week after [Valve admitted](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html) that the [current shortage](https://www.engadget.com/ai/there-arent-any-black-friday-deals-on-ram-this-year-and-you-can-thank-ai-for-that-130000335.html) (and [growing prices](https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-says-ram-costs-will-likely-lead-to-price-hikes-soon-170653524.html)) of RAM were affecting its hardware plans, the Steam Deck is completely sold out. The Steam Deck has gone in and out of stock in the past, but [as _Kotaku_ notes](https://kotaku.com/its-becoming-impossible-to-buy-a-steam-deck-sold-out-valve-prices-ram-shortage-2000667790), the timing does raise the question whether Valve's RAM issues could also be impacting its Linux handheld.

The 256GB Steam Deck LCD, and both the 512GB and 1TB models of the Steam Deck OLED, are completely sold out on Steam. Valve announced that it was [discontinuing the LCD versions of its handheld](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-discontinued-the-last-remaining-lcd-model-of-the-steam-deck-171548195.html) and selling through its remaining inventory in December 2025, so the fact that the 256GB Steam Deck model is currently sold out isn't surprising. That both OLED versions are also unavailable at the same time, though, is a bit more unusual.

Engadget has contacted Valve for more information about the availability of the Steam Deck. We'll update this article if we hear back.

When Valve announced the [Steam Machine, Steam Controller](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html) and [Steam Frame](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html), the company notably left pricing and availability off the table, presumably because tariffs and access to RAM were leaving those details in flux. [The company's announcement](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english) last week that the memory and storage shortage had pushed back its plans and would likely impact prices more or less confirmed that. At no point did Valve mention that the Steam Deck would be similarly affected, but maybe it should have.

The rising cost of RAM has already forced other PC makers to adjust the pricing of their computers. [Framework announced](https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-increases-desktop-prices-by-up-to-460-due-to-ram-crisis-234827145.html) in January that it was raising the price of its Framework Desktop by as much as $460. [Some analysts](https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html) assume that the memory shortage driven by the AI industry could lead to higher prices and even an economic downturn in the wider PC industry. Ideally, the Steam Deck being out of stock is a temporary issue rather than a sign that Valve is doing something drastic. If things continue as they are, however, changes to the Steam Deck likely won't be off the table.
