[Disney](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html) is going after another generative AI tool, accusing ByteDance and its recently released Seedance 2.0 of using its copyrighted material without permission. As first reported on by [_Axios_](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance), the Walt Disney Company sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, claiming the Chinese company developed its Seedance tool "with a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art."

The letter, which was obtained by _Axios_, included examples of Seedance videos featuring copyrighted Disney characters, including Spider-Man, Darth Vader, Peter Griffin and more. Even though ByteDance just released [Seedance 2.0](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/bytedances-new-ai-video-model-goes-viral-china-looks-second-deepseek-moment-2026-02-12/) on Thursday, it's already earned praise, but also indignation from [Hollywood studios](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/hollywood-isnt-happy-about-the-new-seedance-2-0-video-generator/), when it comes to its AI-generating capabilities.

With the strong early momentum, Seedance has already found itself in hot water with one of the largest media companies in the world. However, it's not the first time that Disney has threatened legal action against an AI company, since [Character.AI](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-characterai-220204094.html) received a cease-and-desist letter for the same offense in September. A few months later, Disney even accused [Google](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html) of copyright infringement when training its AI models. On the other hand, Disney partnered with OpenAI in a three-year [licensing agreement](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html) that allows the AI giant to generate images and videos using that highly sought-after intellectual property.
