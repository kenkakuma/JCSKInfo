Google's latest addition to its NotebookLM artificial intelligence research platform is a feature called [Data Tables](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-data-tables/). The tool can collect and synthesize information across multiple sources into a chart that can be exported to Google Sheets. All Pro and Ultra users will have access to the feature today, and Data Tables will roll out to all users over the coming weeks.

In practice, Google suggested that Data Tables can be used to organize scattered notes, create price comparison charts or aggregate results from multiple research projects. The example of the interface shows the desired table components requested in natural language statements.  

Last month, Google added [a Deep Research mode](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-adds-deep-research-capabilities-to-notebooklm-170000817.html) to NotebookLM. Deep Research was initially unveiled for its Gemini chatbot in [late 2024](https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-deep-research-tool-is-here-to-answer-your-most-complicated-questions-154354424.html) as an option for handling complex user queries.
