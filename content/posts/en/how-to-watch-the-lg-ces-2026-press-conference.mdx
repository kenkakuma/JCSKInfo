LG

For years, LG has opened CES press day with the first event of the morning. Though arch-rival [Samsung](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-190027604.html) getting the jump on its fellow Korean rival by giving its presentation the evening before, LG will be hitting the podium at breakfast time with the theme "[Innovation in Tune with You](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d6eb7981-0913-4e7b-bd66-4bc9abdcb17b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LG+Electronics&linkText=Innovation+in+Tune+with+You&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vc2cvYWJvdXQtbGcvcHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2xnLXRvLXNob3djYXNlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW4tdHVuZS13aXRoLXlvdS1hdC1jZXMtMjAyNi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ2ZWI3OTgxLTA5MTMtNGU3Yi1iZDY2LTRiYzlhYmRjYjE3YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3NnL2Fib3V0LWxnL3ByZXNzLWFuZC1tZWRpYS9sZy10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLXR1bmUtd2l0aC15b3UtYXQtY2VzLTIwMjYvIn0&signature=AQAAAcG6Rd6QemxPUL1eIW_tJUMP_5M5-h8dpsAxNuC167Oc&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fsg%2Fabout-lg%2Fpress-and-media%2Flg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026%2F)." 

As with many tech-focused events nowadays, AI is expected to serve as the unifying thread of LG's [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html) presentation. That said, LG — much like Apple — has its own take on the acronym, referring to it as "Affectionate Intelligence." The company will share "its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences." The irony, though, is that LG has already shown its cards, thanks to a long string of pre-show press releases offering details about a litany of new products (see below).
