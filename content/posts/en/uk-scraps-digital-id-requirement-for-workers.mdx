The UK government has backtracked on a plan to [require all workers to have a digital ID](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/uk-announces-plans-for-digital-id-cards-133833359.html) following a backlash. It will no longer be mandatory to register with the digital ID program to prove one has the right to work in the country, as the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3385zrrx73o) reports.

The government announced the now-scrapped digital ID requirement in September. "You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID," Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said at the time. "It's as simple as that." 

The government still plans to fully transition to digital right-to-work checks by 2029, using the likes of biometric passports, as it seeks to do away with paper-based systems. Those are "open to fraud and abuse," a government spokesperson said. 

Officials have still not explained exactly how the digital ID program will work. The government originally framed digital IDs as a way to make it easier to identify immigrants who are working in the country without having the legal right to do so. It is now said to be focusing more on pressing home the message that digital IDs will help people access public services. 

A service called One Login will be part of the digital ID system — this currently can be used for things like applying for a veteran card and canceling a lost passport. More than 12 million people have signed up so far. Another service called Wallet will let people store their digital ID on their phone. This would contain their name, date of birth, nationality, residence status and a photo.

Almost 3 million people [signed an official parliamentary petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/730194) to protest the introduction of digital IDs. "We think this would be a step towards mass surveillance and digital control, and that no one should be forced to register with a state-controlled ID system," the petition states. "We oppose the creation of any national ID system."
