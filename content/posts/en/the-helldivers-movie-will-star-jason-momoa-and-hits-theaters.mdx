Jason Momoa will be playing the lead in the forthcoming film adaptation of the Helldivers gaming franchise, [according to a report by _Variety_](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-november-2027-1236659604/). The games don't have a story-driven protagonist, so Momoa is likely to play a currently unnamed soldier.

We also have a release date for the _Helldivers_ film. It comes out on November 10, 2027. That's a while from now, but at least it gives fans something to look forward to. The movie is [being directed by Justin Lin](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fast--furious-director-justin-lin-is-making-the-helldivers-movie-173429140.html), who is best known for helming several entries in the Fast & Furious franchise. However, he also [directed _Star Trek Beyond_](https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-14-star-trek-beyond-trailer.html), proving he can do sci-fi.

Gary Dauberman is penning the script. He wrote both It and _It Chapter Two_, in addition to the horror film _Annabelle_ and its follow-ups. Dauberman is mostly a horror guy, so we'll have to see how he handles high-octane science fiction.

For the uninitiated, Helldivers is a co-op shooter franchise that's heavily inspired by the movie _Starship Troopers_. The games are set in a hyper-patriotic dystopia called Super Earth. _Helldivers 2_ dropped back in 2024, [though was recently released for Xbox](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-on-august-26-172937757.html).

Sony hasn't announced any other actors who will be joining Momoa. We'll keep you updated when more casting news drops.
