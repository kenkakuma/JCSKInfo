Hisense is typically best known for its affordable electronics and home appliances, from TVs to refrigerators. But at CES 2025, the China-based company showed off its premium side with a massive 136-inch micro LED TV — now available for a jaw-dropping [$100,000](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=9486b306-eae4-49da-a805-9b5cf78d2fb9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Best+Buy&linkText=%24100%2C000&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXN0YnV5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2hpc2Vuc2UtMTM2LWNsYXNzLW14LW1pY3JvLWxlZC1zZXJpZXMtdWhkLTRrLXZpZGFhLXR2LXNtYXJ0LWRpc3BsYXktMjAyNS9KM1o5WjQyNjlZIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NDg2YjMwNi1lYWU0LTQ5ZGEtYTgwNS05YjVjZjc4ZDJmYjkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3RidXkuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvaGlzZW5zZS0xMzYtY2xhc3MtbXgtbWljcm8tbGVkLXNlcmllcy11aGQtNGstdmlkYWEtdHYtc21hcnQtZGlzcGxheS0yMDI1L0ozWjlaNDI2OVkifQ&signature=AQAAAQ89t0paqxpwATdjqp9az6PvRx_kS7XVPyg75kpghW87&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fhisense-136-class-mx-micro-led-series-uhd-4k-vidaa-tv-smart-display-2025%2FJ3Z9Z4269Y). So what's in store for this year's show? New leadership, for starters.

The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a [press release](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-to-appoint-james-fishler-to-c-suite-as-the-company-strengthens-its-u-s-strategy-ahead-o), Hisense said Fishler's experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company "builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES."

We'll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense's presentation and how you can watch it live.

## How to watch Hisense's presentation

Hisense is [livestreaming the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8-2WhTCCI) on its YouTube channel today (Monday, January 5) at 1PM ET. We've embedded it below. 

You can also follow the [Engadget CES 2026 liveblog](https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-las-vegas-153146838.html) for real-time updates from the show.

## What to expect

With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and [Larsen](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-usa-names-sarah-larsen-as-cmo-to-guide-the-brand-s-continued-growth-and-innovation-leadershi), the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/exclusive-hisense-is-betting-on-rgb-tvs-to-shake-up-the-industry-and-make-rivals-nervous), Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company's fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.

As for actual announcements, Hisense has already revealed the following products on its website:

*   [**Hisense S6 FollowMe display**](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-introduces-s6-followme-a-smarter-screen-designed-for-life-in-motion)**:** This is a TV on wheels (really!) that apparently can follow you from room to room. 
    
*   [**Hisense XR10 and PX4-PRO laser projectors**](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-unveils-next-gen-laser-home-cinema-power-at-ces-2026-extending-multi-color-display-leadersh)**:** The company's latest laser projectors can deliver up to 6,000 lumens of brightness and screen sizes as big as 300 inches.
    
*   [**ConnectLife AI-enhanced appliances**](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-appliance-innovations-and-ai-powered-home-assistance-coming-to-ces-2026)**:** In an early [press release](https://www.hisense-usa.com/post/hisense-appliance-innovations-and-ai-powered-home-assistance-coming-to-ces-2026), the company touted (what else) the enhanced AI smarts of its ConnectLife platform, stretching across everything from HVAC systems to kitchen gear to washer/dryers ("... with the enhanced AI Laundry Agent, fabric types and soil levels are automatically identified..."). 
    

Meanwhile, Larsen's aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year's show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both [Samsung](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html) and [LG](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html) have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let's hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.

**Update, January 4 2026, 2:17PM ET:** This story has been updated to include information on the Hisense ConnectLife AI platform.

**Update, January 5 2026, 10:45AM ET:** This story has been updated to include info on Hisense's S6 FollowMe display and laser projectors. 

**Update, January 5 2026, 11:31AM ET:** This story has been updated to include the embedded YouTube livestream.
