Just a day after receiving a roughly [$140 million fine](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-hit-with-140-million-fine-from-the-eu-161259324.html), X has terminated the ad account of the European Commission. [Nikita Bier](https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1997450541275005041?s=20), X's head of product, accused the European Commission of using an exploit to artificially boost the reach of [its post announcing](https://x.com/EU_Commission/status/1996968219286904832?s=20) the major fine.

In the post, Bier said that the commission "logged into \[their\] dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer" and posted "a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach." Bier explained in a [separate post](https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1997454552854065272?s=20) that the exploit has "never been abused like this" and "is now patched." However, X still revoked the European Commission's ability to buy and track ads on its platform.

While X decided to remove the European Commission's ad account, it still needs to submit specific measures and an action plan to address the concerns associated with the $140 million fine. The European Commission's spokesperson for Tech Sovereignty, Defence, Space and Research, Thomas Regnier, said that this is the first-ever fine under the [Digital Services Act](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/ireland-is-investigating-tiktok-and-linkedin-for-possible-dsa-violations-194519622.html). The European legislative body claimed that X has a deceptive system when it comes to verified accounts, lacks transparency with its advertising repository and doesn't provide effective data for researchers. In response, X's owner, Elon Musk, replied to the European Commission's post, calling it "[bullshit](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1997009604681896340)."
