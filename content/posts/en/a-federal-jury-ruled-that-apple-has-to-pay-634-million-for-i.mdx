In a longstanding and complicated [legal battle](https://www.engadget.com/apple-infringed-masimo-pulse-oximeter-patent-103726704.html) between Apple and Masimo, a recent ruling from a California jury may be the first step towards a certain conclusion. As reported by [_Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-jury-says-apple-must-pay-masimo-634-million-smartwatch-patent-case-2025-11-15/), a federal jury sided with Masimo, a medical tech company known for its patient monitoring devices, when it said that Apple infringed on the company's patent for technology that tracks blood-oxygen levels.

The case revolves around whether Apple violated Masimo's patent related to blood-oxygen sensors, which the jury claimed can be seen with the Apple Watch's Workout and Heart Rate apps. According to _Reuters_, Apple disagreed with the verdict, adding that "the single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago." The tech giant is reportedly planning to appeal the decision. 

While there may be some closure with this California lawsuit, Apple and Masimo are entangled in a web of related but separate lawsuits. Masimo first accused Apple of infringing on its pulse oximeter patents, leading to Apple [temporarily halting sales](https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-pause-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-in-the-us-due-to-a-patent-dispute-142051903.html) of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches. In August, Apple redesigned its blood-oxygen monitoring feature and rolled it out to the Series 9, Series 10 and Ultra 2. The redesign was approved by the US Customs and Border Protection, but Masimo [filed a suit](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html) against the agency for overstepping its authority by allowing the sale of these updated Apple Watches without input from Masimo.
