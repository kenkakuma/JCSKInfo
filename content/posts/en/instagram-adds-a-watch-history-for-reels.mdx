Instagram's latest feature should make it easier to resurface videos you've viewed. On Friday, Adam Mosseri [revealed](https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DQMcanmgCvL) a new watch history for Reels. "Hopefully, now you can find that thing that you were trying to find that you couldn't find before," the Instagram CEO said.

We could see the feature coming in handy. For example, when you see something interesting but lose it due to an accidental tap or app refresh.

You can find it on Instagram under **Settings > Your activity > Watch history**. The feature lets you sort by newest to oldest or vice versa. You can also jump to a specific date or date range, and filter by the account that posted it.
