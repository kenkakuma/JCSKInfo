_Killing Satoshi_, an upcoming biopic about the elusive creator of Bitcoin, will reportedly rely heavily on artificial intelligence to generate locations and adjust actors' performances, [_Variety_ reports](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/pete-davidson-killing-satoshi-ai-doug-liman-ryan-kavanaugh-1236661170/). The film was [announced in 2025](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/doug-liman-casey-affleck-pete-davidson-bitcoin-killing-satoshi-1236501408/) as being directed by Doug Liman (_The Bourne Identity_, _The Edge of Tomorrow_) and starring Casey Affleck and Pete Davidson in undisclosed roles, but its connection to overhyped technology was previously understood to begin and end with cryptocurrency.

According to a UK casting notice viewed by _Variety_, the producers of _Killing Satoshi_ reserve the right to "change, add to, take from, translate, reformat or reprocess” actors' performances, using "generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and/or machine learning technologies." No digital replicas will be created of performers, but it sounds like plenty of other AI-driven tweaks are on the table. The production's use of AI will also extend to the setting of its shoots, per Variety's source. _Killing Satoshi_ will be shot on a "markerless performative capture stage" and things like backgrounds and locations will be entirely generated by AI.

You guess is as good as mine as to why a film about blockchain technology needs to be filmed this way, but Doug Liman has been connected with plenty of unusual projects in the past, including [a rumored Tom Cruise film](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/doug-liman-direct-tom-cruise-space-set-movie-1296052/) that was supposed to film on the International Space Station. _Killing Satoshi_ will be far less practical in comparison, and walking a much finer line of what's acceptable in the entertainment industry.

A major sticking point in [SAG-AFTRA's 2023 contract negotiations](https://www.engadget.com/sag-aftra-deal-includes-a-40-million-streaming-bonus-and-ai-protections-204526458.html?src=rss++++++++++++++++++++++++) was guaranteeing protections for actors who could be replaced by AI. Equity, the union representing actors in the UK, is [currently negotiating protections](https://news.sky.com/story/actors-union-offered-better-deal-over-ai-protections-13496767) for members that are concerned that AI could be used to reproduce their likenesses and voices and let studios use them without their consent.
