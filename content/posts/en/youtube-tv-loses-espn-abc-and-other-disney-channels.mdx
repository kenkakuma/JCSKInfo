Disney's channels have gone dark on YouTube TV after the companies failed to [reach an agreement](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-warns-that-youtube-tv-could-lose-its-channels-amid-fee-negotations-155347776.html) by their October 30 deadline. The affected channels include ESPN, local ABC stations, ABC News, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. "Last week Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers," [_YouTube_](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/?sjid=11269581620476450138-NA) said in an [announcement on its blog](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/?sjid=11269581620476450138-NA). "They’re now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV." YouTube added that Disney's decision harms its subscribers while benefiting its own live TV products, such as Hulu+Live TV and Fubo.

In a statement sent to the [_Los Angeles Times_](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-10-30/espn-abc-disney-blackout-youtube-tv-contract-dispute), however, Disney accused Google's YouTube TV of choosing to deny "subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for \[its\] channels, including ESPN and ABC." Disney also accused Google of using its market dominance to "eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms" that other pay-TV distributors have agreed to pay for its content. YouTube TV lost access to Disney channels back in 2021, but they were immediately able to strike a deal that [restored the channels](https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-disney-channels-back-espn-abc-213518747.html) the very next day. The companies are most likely still trying to negotiate at the moment, but Google says it will offer subscribers a $20 credit if Disney channels remain offline for an extended period of time. 

Google has had to make several similar announcements over the past year. In February, YouTube TV [almost lost Paramount content](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-has-reached-a-deal-with-paramount-to-keep-carrying-cbs-cbs-sports-and-other-channels-154245757.html), including CBS, CBS Sports and Nickelodeon, before reaching a last-minute deal. The same thing happened in August [with Fox](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-subscribers-wont-lose-access-to-fox-content-after-all-130054330.html). More recently, Google and NBCUniversal also [came to an agreement](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/google-and-nbcuniversal-reach-multi-year-agreement-for-youtube-tv-120051505.html) at the eleventh hour, though YouTube TV [lost access to Univision](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-keeps-nbc-with-a-last-minute-extension-but-loses-univision-121508916.html), the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US.
