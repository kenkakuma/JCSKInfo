Google has started [rolling out](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-photos-can-now-turn-you-into-a-meme-213930935.html) a new feature for its Photos app that can turn your images into memes. The feature, called Me Meme, uses Google Gemini to take meme templates and recreate them with the photo you use from within the app. It’s still in its experimental stages and will only be available for users in the US in the English language. In addition, it seems to be rolling out for Android users only at the moment, and Google warns that the generated images may not match the original photo at times. If you do get access to the feature soon, check out the instructions below on how to use it.

1.  Open your Photos app. Go to the Create tab at the bottom and find the Me Meme option. If it’s not showing up even though you’re an Android user in the US, you’ll have to wait for it as it continues rolling out. Google told [_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/google-photos-latest-feature-lets-you-meme-yourself/) that it will reach iOS users over the coming weeks.
    
2.  You’ll see onscreen instructions the first time you use it. The next time you access the feature, you’ll go straight to the meme creation process.
    
3.  You can browse and choose one of the preset templates Google provides, but you can also upload a meme or any other image as a template.
    
4.  You then have to upload a photo that you want to insert into the meme. Google advises using a selfie or a photo where your face is clearly visible.
    
5.  After you tap Generate, you can save the meme if you’re satisfied with the result or share it directly to social media platforms online. You can also tap Regenerate to see a different output.
    

[_Android Authority_](https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/2014523215117484222) spotted the feature in October 2025 and was able to try it out before its limited release. You can see an example of Me Meme’s output below.
