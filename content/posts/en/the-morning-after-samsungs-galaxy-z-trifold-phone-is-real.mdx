As promised, we’re back to normal. Don’t even think about buying Kindles or subscribing to a new streaming service until Black Friday 2026.

Instead, let’s talk about a new Samsung foldable with even more folds. The [Galaxy Z TriFold](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-fully-unveils-its-galaxy-z-trifold-phone-and-itll-be-available-in-korea-in-a-few-days-010000499.html) is breaking cover and will launch in Korea and other select countries (read: not the US) on December 12.

Unlike the early trifold from Huawei, the smartphone has an inward-folding display meant to protect the wider main display, 10 inches wide. The cover screen is 6.5 inches when folded, while the entire TriFold is 12.9mm when collapsed and 3.9mm at its thinnest when unfolded.

That might seem a bit chunky in the face of super-thin smartphones, but it’s much thinner than Samsung’s first Z Fold (17.1mm), back in 2019. Arguably, it’s a 10-inch tablet (with the right screen ratio) crammed into a smartphone form factor.

The phone runs on a custom Snapdragon 8 chip, with a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery and support for 45W super-fast charging. Like the Z Fold 7, the rear camera lineup includes a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 200MP wide-angle lens and a 10MP telephoto lens.

Intrigued? Samsung says the TriFold will be available in the US and elsewhere in the first quarter of 2026. The company hasn’t stipulated pricing yet, but it could be [spicy](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/huaweis-first-tri-fold-phone-starts-at-an-eye-watering-2800-145113669.html).

## [Netflix ends casting from mobile devices for users of newer TVs](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-ends-casting-from-mobile-devices-for-users-of-newer-tvs-151921578.html)

### You should still be able to cast to older Chromecast or Google Cast devices.

Struggled to cast _Stranger Things_ over the long weekend? It wasn’t you — and it probably wasn’t your TV’s fault either. Netflix is ending support for casting from mobile devices to many TVs. According to a help page spotted by _Android Authority_, “Netflix no longer supports casting shows from a mobile device to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. You’ll need to use the remote that came with your TV or TV-streaming device to navigate Netflix.” The company previously removed AirPlay support in 2019 due to “technical limitations.”

## [Apple’s new vice president of AI is a Google veteran](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-hires-google-veteran-as-its-new-vice-president-of-ai-234820021.html)

### Embattled exec John Giannandrea is leaving the company.

Apple has hired AI researcher Amar Subramanya, a longtime Google exec, pulling him away from Microsoft to push its AI efforts forward. Subramanya, who Apple describes as a “renowned AI researcher,” spent 16 years at Google, where he was head of engineering for Gemini. The company also announced that current AI exec, John Giannandrea, will retire in 2026.

Giannandrea has shouldered much of the blame for the delays in delivering the next-generation version of Siri. He joined Apple in 2018 after a stint at Google that included VP of search. While his hiring was seen as a major coup for Apple at the time, the company has failed to deliver its more personalized AI-centric version of Siri, previewed earlier last year. Not earlier this year: last year.

Google has announced that free users can currently generate two images per day, down from three previously, on its Nano Bana Pro image generator. “Image generation and editing is in high demand,” the company writes. “Limits may change frequently and will reset daily.”

This is due to the new model being a big improvement on what came before. The text rendering portion is significantly improved and can even render legible text on top of an existing image. It can also blend multiple elements into a single composition, supporting up to 14 images at once. Google is also limiting free Gemini 3 Pro use.
