Microsoft officially ended support for Windows 10 today, October 14, 2025, marking the conclusion of a decade-long run for the operating system that still powers an estimated 500 million computers worldwide. The tech giant released its final security update, KB5066791, yesterday as the last free patch for the platform.​

The end of support means Microsoft will no longer provide security updates, bug fixes, or technical assistance for Windows 10 devices through its standard Windows Update service. However, users unwilling or unable to upgrade to Windows 11 can extend their protection through the company's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.​

**Free and Paid Extension Options Available**

Users have multiple pathways to maintain security beyond today's deadline. The ESU program offers an additional year of critical security updates until October 13, 2026, with Microsoft providing three enrollment options:​

For users outside the European Economic Area, the standard ESU enrollment costs $30 annually. However, two free alternatives exist: syncing Windows settings with Microsoft's OneDrive cloud service or redeeming 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.​

European users received more favorable terms after regulatory pressure. Following challenges under the Digital Markets Act, Microsoft announced that ESU access will be completely free for users in the European Economic Area, with no cloud backup requirements.​

**Hardware Compatibility Drives User Retention**

Windows 10's continued popularity stems largely from Windows 11's stringent hardware requirements, which demand 8th generation Intel processors or AMD Zen 2 chips, along with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 support. These restrictions have left millions of functional computers unable to upgrade, despite being sold within the past decade.​

According to StatCounter data, approximately 40.5% of Windows users remained on Windows 10 as of September 2025. Industry experts estimate that around 30% of PC gamers also continue using the older operating system.​

**Security Risks Mount Without Updates**

Cybersecurity specialists warn that unprotected Windows 10 devices will become increasingly vulnerable to malware and security threats. "These updates are critical for protecting your computer and devices," said digital security expert Ritesh Kotak. "These patches provide protection against malware and provide stability."​

Microsoft emphasizes that the ESU program serves as "a temporary measure to ensure security while users upgrade to a newer, supported system," rather than a long-term solution. The company continues encouraging users to transition to Windows 11, which it describes as offering "a more modern, secure and highly efficient computing experience."​
