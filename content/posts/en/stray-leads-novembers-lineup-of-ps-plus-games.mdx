Sony just announced the [PS Plus Monthly games for November](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/) and there are some standouts. All of these titles will be available to download on November 4 until December 1.

First up, there's the cat sim _Stray_. We praised the third-person cyberpunk adventure [in our initial review](https://www.engadget.com/stray-review-ps5-cyberpunk-adventure-cute-cat-173018571.html), in which we lauded the game's unique mechanics and puzzles. After all, you play as a cat in a dystopian and futuristic city. That's a one-of-a-kind premise, which is one reason it [became such a big hit](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/beloved-cat-sim-stray-comes-to-the-switch-on-november-19-184048780.html). It'll be available for both PS4 and PS5. It's also worth noting that this was a day-one release for PS Plus Extra and Premium back in 2022. 

_EA Sports WRC 24_ is a popular racing sim developed by Codemasters, who made the Dirt series, the Grid franchise and plenty of official F1 games. This new one lets players participate in the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC.) Racers get access to a bunch of WRC, WRC2 and Junior WRC cars from the 2024 season, complete with current drivers and teams. This one is only for PS5.

_Totally Accurate Battle Simulator_ is certainly a battle similar, but not an accurate one. The game lets you design all kinds of bizarre battle scenarios with "the wobbliest physics system ever created." This is the best game ever made that lets you battle a wooly mammoth with balloon arrows, thus forcing that beast into the sky. It'll be available for both PS4 and PS5.

As always, a crop of new games means that some pre-existing titles are heading to that farm upstate. You have until November 3 to download _Alan Wake 2_, _Goat Simulator 3_ and _Cocoon_ to their game library. Dang. Last month was stacked.
