Elon Musk and his aerospace company have requested to build a network that's 100 times the number of satellites that are currently in orbit. On Friday, SpaceX [filed an application](https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/icfs?id=ibfs_application_summary&number=SAT-LOA-20260108-00016) with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch a million satellites meant to create an "orbital data center." This isn't the first time we're hearing of Musk's plans to build an orbital data center, as it was mentioned by company insiders following the news that the CEO was reportedly preparing to [take SpaceX public](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musk-is-reportedly-trying-to-take-spacex-public-170337053.html).

According to the filing spotted by [_PCMag_](https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-eyes-1-million-satellites-for-orbital-data-center-push?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&test_variant=B), this data center would run off solar power and deliver computing capacity for [artificial intelligence needs](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-are-reportedly-holding-merger-talks-211740150.html). SpaceX is requesting to "deploy a system of up to one million satellites to operate within narrow orbital shells spanning up to 50 km each," as detailed in the filing. According to SpaceX's filing, "orbital data centers are the most efficient way to meet the accelerating demand for AI computing power" since they use "solar power with little operating and maintenance costs."

To give some scale of the astronomical number of satellites SpaceX is asking for, the company recently hit a milestone of the 11,000th Starlink satellite launched. There aren't as many in orbit since the satellites can run into issues, but an [unofficial website](https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html) that tracks Starlink stats claims there are more than 9,600 satellites in orbit as of January 30, 2026. The FCC is likely to whittle down the amount that SpaceX is asking for in its filing, as the federal agency has done in the past. Earlier this month, the FCC approved [SpaceX's request](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-can-deploy-7500-more-starlink-gen2-satellites-with-fcc-approval-180000843.html) to deploy 7,500 more Starlink satellites, following another 7,500 launched in 2022. However, it's much less than the nearly 30,000 amount that SpaceX first asked for in 2020.
