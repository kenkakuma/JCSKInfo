We’ve slept off our collective turkey coma and returned to the review lab here at Engadget. Our team may also be [in full CES prep mode](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-at-ces-2026-120000278.html), but we’ve got a few more devices to get off or our desks before 2025 is over. Catch up on all of the [reviews](https://www.engadget.com/reviews/) you might have missed over the last few weeks — a perfect activity for a lazy December weekend.

## Dell 16 Premium

There’s no denying the design of the Dell 16 Premium makes the laptop live up to its name. Unfortunately, all of that polish leads to some issues: a high price and hampered usability. “The more I looked at the Dell 16 Premium's beautiful facade, the more I wanted something... more,” [senior reporter Devindra Hardawar wrote](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-16-premium-review-stylish-to-a-fault-130000463.html). “It needs more usable ports, like HDMI and a full-sized SD card reader. It needs more useful function keys that are visible in bright light — and also stay in one place — so I can touch type more easily. And for the love of god, just give up on the invisible trackpad.”

## DJI Osmo Action 6

DJI’s drone business in the US faces an uncertain future, and the company’s action cams could be swept up in the ordeal as well. Thankfully, our contributing reporter Steve Dent resides in the EU where he observed first hand the Osmo Action 6’s superior low light performance and battery life. “With a bigger sensor and larger aperture than the competition, DJI’s Action 6 is now the best action cam on the market for night shooting, delivering clean, sharp video with better stabilization than rivals,” [he said](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-action-6-review-an-action-camera-that-excels-in-low-light-143027343.html). “It’s also ideal for users who output to both YouTube and TikTok.”

## Nikon ZR

In keeping with the video theme, Steve also spent time testing the Nikon ZR. While this is primarily a model for shooting video, it benefits from the addition of RED RAW, excellent autofocus and more. “With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation,” [he explained](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-zr-review-a-highly-capable-cinema-camera-at-a-reasonable-price-152634311.html). “Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises.”

## Ooni Volt 2

The Ooni Volt brought the company’s popular brand of pizza making indoors for the first time, but that model wasn’t without it faults. Now Ooni is back with the Volt 2, and the completely overhauled design is a big upgrade over the original. “It’s easier to use for all skill levels thanks to its clearer controls and large display,” [I explained](https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ooni-volt-2-review-a-strong-case-for-an-indoor-pizza-oven-193000311.html). “Presets work well, but they can also serve as a starting point for further recipe refinement for experienced users. And the pizza — my goodness, the pizza is consistently restaurant quality (or better) across a range of styles.”

## Antigravity A1

Insta360’s spin-off Antigravity is now shipping its first drone and our UK bureau chief Mat Smith has already flown it. The A1 comes with a controller and FPV headset to assist with the piloting, but the mix of unique features and crisp video (in good conditions) is also laudable. “The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available,” [he said](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html). “It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests.”

## Other recent reviews

On the gaming front, Mat spent some time with [_Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-140000972.html) while deputy editor Nathan Ingraham put [_Metroid Prime 4_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-an-excellent-modernization-but-not-a-total-reinvention-150000082.html) through its paces. Contributor Tim Stevens stepped back in time with the [Analogue 3D](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html) to revisit some Nintendo 64 classics after getting behind the wheel of the [2025 Porsche Macan Electric](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/2025-porsche-macan-electric-review-the-obvious-choice-when-the-budget-allows-140000851.html).
