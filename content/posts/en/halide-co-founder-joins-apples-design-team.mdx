Apple picked up an intriguing new member for its design team today in Sebastiaan de With, co-founder of the iPhone camera app Halide. He [announced](https://www.threads.com/@sdw/post/DUEeAwFksRt) the move today on Threads, adding, "So excited to work with the very best team in the world on my favorite products."

The Halide app has caught our eye at Engadget at [several](https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-18-best-iphone-camera-apps.html) [points](https://www.engadget.com/apps/iphone-camera-app-halide-has-an-anti-intelligent-mode-to-make-shooting-with-raw-easier-211802575.html) over the years. de With also is co-founder of Lux, which is Halide's parent company. The other Lux apps also have an emphasis on photography and videography, particularly on Apple devices. Prior to Halide, de With had done other work at Apple, collaborating on properties including iCloud, MobileMe and Find My apps. It's unclear if his exit will mean any notable changes for Halide, or for the Lux apps Kino, Spectre and Orion.

For a long time, Apple's design philosophy was personified by Jony Ive, who [left](https://www.engadget.com/apple-jony-ive-parting-ways-043055842.html) the company in 2022. Since his departure, no single person has emerged as the face and voice of Apple's attitude toward design, which could be why recent moves such as Liquid Glass have been met with [deeply divided reactions](https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html).
