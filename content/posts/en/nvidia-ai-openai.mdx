Nvidia today announced the launch of its DGX Spark, a desktop AI supercomputer that delivers petaflop-scale performance in a compact 2.6-pound form factor. The system, which TIME Magazine named one of the Best Inventions of 2025, will be available for purchase starting Wednesday, October 15, for $3,999.​

In a symbolic gesture echoing the company's history, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first DGX Spark unit to Elon Musk at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas today. The delivery mirrors a similar moment in 2016 when Huang delivered the first DGX-1 supercomputer to Musk's then-startup OpenAI, which later contributed to the development of ChatGPT.​

**Desktop-Class AI Computing Power**

The DGX Spark is powered by Nvidia's new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, delivering up to 1 petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a desktop-friendly package. Despite its compact size, the system can run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models up to 70 billion parameters locally.​

"In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer," said Huang. "With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs".​

The system addresses growing demands from AI developers who are finding traditional PCs, workstations, and laptops insufficient for modern AI workloads, forcing them to rely on expensive cloud computing or data center resources.​

**Broad Industry Adoption**

Major technology companies are already testing and validating the DGX Spark platform. Early recipients include Google, Meta, Microsoft, Hugging Face, Docker, and research institutions like NYU's Global Frontier Lab.​

The system will be available through multiple channels, including Nvidia.com and partner systems from Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, and MSI. Additionally, users can link two Spark systems together to handle even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.​

The DGX Spark runs on Nvidia's proprietary DGX OS, a Linux-based operating system optimized for AI development, with the company's comprehensive AI software stack preinstalled for immediate use. This positions the device as a bridge between local AI development and enterprise-scale deployment, allowing developers to prototype models locally before scaling to Nvidia's DGX Cloud or other accelerated infrastructure.​
