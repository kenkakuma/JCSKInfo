Anthropic unveiled Claude Haiku 4.5 on Wednesday, a compact AI model that delivers coding performance comparable to the company's Claude Sonnet 4 while operating at one-third the cost and more than double the speed. The release marks a significant step in making advanced AI capabilities more accessible and economical for widespread deployment.

The new model is immediately available to all users and becomes the default option for free Claude.ai subscribers, representing what Anthropic calls a breakthrough in balancing performance with efficiency. According to the company, Haiku 4.5 achieves 73% on the SWE-bench Verified coding evaluation, matching the performance of models that were considered state-of-the-art just five months ago.​

**Cost-Effective AI for Real-Time Applications**

Priced at $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens, Claude Haiku 4.5 costs significantly less than larger models while maintaining competitive performance. For comparison, Claude Sonnet 4 and 4.5 cost $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.​

The model excels in latency-sensitive applications including chatbots, customer service agents, and pair programming tasks. Its enhanced speed makes it particularly suitable for real-time interactions where response time is critical.​

"Haiku 4.5 proves you can have both intelligence and rapid output," said Brad Axen from Block Inc in a statement provided by Anthropic. "It handles complex workflows reliably, self-corrects in real-time, and maintains momentum without latency overhead."​

**Multi-Agent Capabilities and Platform Integration**

A key innovation with Haiku 4.5 is its ability to work alongside Anthropic's more powerful models in multi-agent configurations. Claude Sonnet 4.5 can handle complex planning and strategy while multiple Haiku 4.5 instances execute subtasks in parallel. This approach enables more sophisticated workflows in coding, financial analysis, and research applications at reduced computational costs.​

The model is available through Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI. Additionally, Claude Haiku 4.5 has been integrated into GitHub Copilot, where it's now available in public preview for Pro, Business, and Enterprise users.​

GitHub Copilot users can access the model across Visual Studio Code, GitHub.com, and mobile platforms, with gradual rollout ongoing. The integration represents a significant expansion of Haiku 4.5's reach into developer workflows where speed and cost efficiency are paramount.​

**Enhanced Safety Profile**

Anthropic reports that Claude Haiku 4.5 demonstrates the company's safest performance to date, with statistically significantly lower rates of misaligned behaviors compared to both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.1. The model has been released under the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) standard, a less restrictive classification than the ASL-3 rating applied to Anthropic's more powerful models.​

Safety testing showed limited risks regarding chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons production, supporting the ASL-2 designation. This safety profile makes Haiku 4.5 particularly attractive for enterprise deployments where compliance and risk management are critical considerations.​

The launch comes as AI companies increasingly focus on developing smaller, more efficient models that can deliver strong performance while reducing server costs and energy consumption. With Haiku 4.5, Anthropic positions itself to compete more effectively in cost-sensitive markets while maintaining the advanced capabilities that have distinguished its Claude family of models.​
