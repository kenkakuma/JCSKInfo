_Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024_ [just got a fairly bizarre expansion](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-introduces-netflixs-stranger-things-expansion/) inspired by the Netflix show _Stranger Things_. If you've ever wanted to fly over a fictional Indiana town in the 1980s, this is the update for you.

That's right. The game now lets folks fly over Hawkins, Indiana and check out more than 40 iconic locations from the series, including Starcourt Mall, the junkyard, the government lab and, of course, the upside down.

Inexplicably, this isn't just a joyride. There's an actual game here, with five helicopter-based missions that have players arranging supply drops, rescuing characters and chasing bad guys. Murray Bauman, portrayed by Brett Gelman, is on hand to assign missions and engage in banter.

This is a free update and it's available right now, so get out there and blast that one Kate Bush song over and over (and over.) As for _Stranger Things_, the second part of season five [drops on December 25](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-drops-one-more-stranger-things-trailer-before-season-five-begins-152951886.html), followed by the series finale on January 1. _Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024_, which [first came out](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsofts-flight-simulator-2024-launch-day-users-seeing-long-loading-times-203805287.html) last year, [recently launched for PS5](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-is-coming-to-ps5-on-december-8-213203456.html).
