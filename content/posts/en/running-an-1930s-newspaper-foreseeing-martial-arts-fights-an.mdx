Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. A whole bunch of intriguing games have arrived over the last week or so, and we got some tasty details on some upcoming projects, including one called _Drywall Eating Simulator_ (trust me on this one).

But first, an update on a game that's been around since 2004 and had completely flown below my radar until now. That’s despite it reaching more than 80,000 daily unique players and having more than 4 million players overall. You can seemingly do pretty much whatever you want in [_Torn_](https://www.torn.com/), including studying to become a doctor, opening a hair salon or buying a home (it's truly a fantasy world). However, this is a place where crime is rife. The team behind the text-based online RPG this week revealed some fascinating stats to mark the 21st anniversary. 

For instance, 1,204 people who joined the fray in 2004 are still active, including at least one who has been there since the first day. Since Torn City was established 21 years ago, more than 3.6 billion criminal offenses have been committed and yet its justice system has only doled out just under 52 million prison sentences. Since August alone, more than 4.4 million buildings have been burned. Players have committed more than 410 million assaults against each other, 12 percent of which targeted the groin. 

_Torn_ sounds super fascinating! I love that it's been running for so long and still thriving. More than 31,000 players have subscribed to support the game and keep it running, though it’s free to play. The developers have updates planned for next year and beyond. I'm looking forward to checking it out at some point and maybe roleplaying as a goody-two-shoes flower shop owner. 

## New releases

From publisher Twin Sails Interactive and the four-strong team at Sparrow Night comes _News Tower_, which arrived fully formed this week after nearly two years in early access. This is a management sim that tasks you with running your own newspaper in 1930s New York. 

Starting in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and mobsters smashing up the newsroom, you'll try to turn around a struggling publication that you inherit from your family. You'll construct offices and set up printing presses; hire and manage reporters and other staff; assemble your weekly newspaper; and deal with various groups that are jostling for power and trying to influence your coverage. 

I thought last year's _Times and Galaxy_, which casts you in the role of a robot journalist, was mostly lovely, but it missed the mark on the actual newsgathering side of the equation. I’ve found no such issues with _News Tower_ so far. I love that [a story can change](https://www.gamefile.news/p/news-tower-review) when you assign different reporters to each step (say, one focused on crime vs. one focused on politics). They'll find distinct angles, which could help you sell more copies of the paper or draw readers away from rivals when you land an exclusive.

I'm only a little ways into _News Tower_, but as someone who started out their career at a newspaper, this is like catnip to me. I expect to spend quite a bit of time with this game. _News Tower_ 1.0 is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649950/News_Tower/). It usually costs $25, though there's a 20 percent discount until December 2.

_Forestrike_ is a 2D martial arts roguelite from Skeleton Crew. You can practice combat encounters as many times as you like, but you only have one proper shot to take out multiple opponents in each battle. It sounds a little like _Katana Zero_ in that regard. Succeed, and you'll move forward. Lose, and it's the end of your run. If you manage to win without relying on this foresight feature, you'll achieve an "ultimate victory."

On each run, you'll choose your path and learn new techniques. _Forestrike,_ which is published by Devolver Digital, seems interesting since it's a blend of puzzle game and action roguelite — you'll need to figure out a way to succeed in each battle and then pull that off successfully on your actual attempt. The game is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325920/Forestrike/) for $10. It's coming to Nintendo Switch soon.

Here's a puzzle game of a different flavor. In _Umami,_ from Mimmox and co-publisher Nexting, the aim is to create dioramas of cakes and food towers using virtual wooden blocks. You have a reference guide to work from if you choose, or you can just try to figure out for yourself how all the pieces fit together. 

It's a lovely, relaxing experience with some laid-back beats. _Umami_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669360/UMAMI/). It's usually priced at $14, though there's a 15 percent discount until December 1.

_A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad_ is a game from Azimuth Studios in the vein of rage-inducing precision platformers like _Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy_ and _Only Up._ The aim is to guide a person who is trapped in a pinball to the goal using a single button that controls the flippers.

Make a mistake, and you can erase a great deal of progress. A press release indicated that a playthrough will take between 10 and 30 hours, which is a huge range.

I'll never find out myself how accurate that estimated playtime is, because the demo did, in fact, make me mad and not want to play the full game, though I appreciate what the devs are going for. _A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3796230/A_Pinball_Game_That_Makes_You_Mad/) for $10, but a 15 percent discount until November 25 brings the price down to $8.50.

I really like that I've been able to keep up with this little tradition of including a dog game in this roundup every week. _Samurai Academy: Paws of Fury_ is a followup to _Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank,_ a 2022 animated movie I haven't seen that's apparently a "loose remake of _Blazing Saddles_." Color me intrigued!

This is an action-adventure game with platforming and tower defense aspects. It casts you in the role of Hank, a "dog samurai in a world full of cats." It looks quite charming, though it does remind me that I really do need to go back and get the platinum trophy in _Ghost of Yōtei_. _Samurai Academy: Paws of Fury_ — from developers Fishing Cactus and ZEROlife Games, and publisher Maximum Entertainment — is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3735230/Samurai_Academy_Paws_of_Fury/), [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/samurai-academy-paws-of-fury-switch/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015397), and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5b005a7a-9872-4944-8f28-49fd9b9ed943&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zYW11cmFpLWFjYWRlbXktcGF3cy1vZi1mdXJ5LzltdGMybTVxcnJqaCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWIwMDVhN2EtOTg3Mi00OTQ0LThmMjgtNDlmZDliOWVkOTQzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zYW11cmFpLWFjYWRlbXktcGF3cy1vZi1mdXJ5LzltdGMybTVxcnJqaCJ9&signature=AQAAAQCnImKqGpn-sde3VY43c_HnyJu4Ow4FcAAs0uIRLT3y&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fsamurai-academy-paws-of-fury%2F9mtc2m5qrrjh). There's a two-player co-op mode available on all platforms, except for Switch.

## Upcoming 

_Erosion_ is a neat-looking twin-stick action roguelike from Plot Twist (_The Last Case of Benedict Fox_) and publisher Lyrical Games. Every time you die, time advances by a decade and the post-apocalyptic Wild West setting shifts accordingly, with the decisions you make influencing the future. 

In this open-world shooter, you'll delve into dungeons filled with enemies and bosses as you try to rescue your kidnapped daughter. Avoid death often enough, and you might just find your offspring before she reaches old age. There are more than 100 skills and modifiers to unlock and dozens of weapons available to help you assemble an effective build. The environments are destructible too.

I really like the voxel art here, including the way the characters bob up and down. _Erosion_ is set to arrive in spring 2026 in early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211720/Erosion/), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Cloud and the Xbox PC app. It'll be available on Game Pass.

Speaking of Xbox, one of my favorite games of last year is coming to Microsoft's consoles. The comedy adventure [_Thank Goodness You’re Here!_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/thank-goodness-youre-here-is-a-vibrant-funny-unashamedly-silly-game-133030648.html) is slated to hit Xbox Series X/S on December 9. The delightfully rude and funny game from Coal Supper and Panic is already out on PC, PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch. 

We're far from done with the silliness this week. If you haven't quite had your fill of obstacle-laden walking sims for this year after Baby Steps, might I direct your attention toward _Ultimate Grandma Simulator_? 

You'll help Granny navigate a dozen levels as she searches for her missing grandson. You'll need to evade everything from wrecking balls to zombies, and parry projectiles like frisbees and bombs. A serious game this is not. If you collect hidden golden coins, you'll unlock some of Granny's memories too. Circo, PlumPointTwo and publisher We Don't Have A Studio are set to bring _Ultimate Grandma Simulator_ to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3511870/Ultimate_Grandma_Simulator/) on December 2.

I must admit, the title of _Drywall Eating Simulator_ caught my attention and not in a good way. But after reading more about it and watching the trailer, I'm intrigued by this game from Peripheral Playbox.

According to the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3749110/Drywall_Eating_Simulator/), it's a "physics-based 3D adventure carefully constructed to simulate the delights of late capitalist life." After engaging in mindnumbing small talk and dealing with the infuriating stressors of everyday life, what better way to unwind than by munching on some drywall? Just don't tell anyone about your cravings. 

This game has a very odd and yet somehow deeply relatable concept. Definitely something to chew on. It's coming to Steam on December 10.
