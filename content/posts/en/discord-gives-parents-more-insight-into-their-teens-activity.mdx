Discord has been trying to strike a balance between affording teen users their privacy and allowing for parental oversight. Over the next week, the platform is rolling out some updates for its [Family Center](https://www.engadget.com/new-family-center-tool-gives-parents-better-insight-into-their-teens-discord-usage-150014579.html) with the aim of helping parents gain more understanding of what their teens are doing on Discord, while giving them the ability to manage certain settings. 

Parents and guardians were already able to see an overview of some of their teens' Discord activity. Now, they'll be able to view all purchases for the previous seven days; exactly how long teens have spent in voice and video calls across direct messages, servers and group DMs; and the five users and servers that a teen has called and messaged most often over the last week.

Teens will have the option to notify a guardian when they report another user or a piece of content to Discord. The guardian will receive an email telling them that their teen filed a report but not the details. The idea behind that is to have a conversation about the report and for the guardian to lend their support.

In addition, Discord is adding guardian-managed settings to Family Center. These include the ability to determine who can DM a teen and if sensitive content filters are enabled. Guardians will have access to some data privacy controls too.

Discord said it designed the updates with teens in mind and to make sure they can maintain their independence while having the parental support they might need. Guardians can't see the content of messages that their teens send. Teens can also view the same information as their guardians in Family Center. 

To use Family Center, guardians and teens need to link their accounts. They can do so by going to **User Settings > Family Center** in the Discord app.

As with other social platforms, Discord is under the spotlight when it comes to the safety of young users. Earlier this year, New Jersey's attorney general [sued Discord](https://www.engadget.com/apps/new-jersey-ag-sues-discord-over-alleged-child-safety-failures-184501604.html), claiming that it "misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application." 

**Update, November 5, 2025, 1:01PM ET:** A previous version of this story indicated that Australia was considering banning under 16s from using Discord. This is not the case, as Discord [will not be considered](https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted) an age-restricted social media platform by Australian officials. We regret the error.
