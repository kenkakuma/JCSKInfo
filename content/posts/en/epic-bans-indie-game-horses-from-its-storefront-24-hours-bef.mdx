Indie studio Santa Ragione is facing more strife after claiming its latest game has been blocked on another major storefront. The developer previously said it was [at risk of closure](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-indie-studio-says-its-at-risk-of-closure-after-valve-banned-its-game-from-steam-210047830.html) after Valve banned _Horses_ from Steam, noting that it would be very difficult to recoup its investment without access to the world’s largest PC gaming storefront. The situation became more dire this week after Epic Games blocked _Horses_ as well.

Santa Ragione said Epic notified the studio of its decision just 24 hours before the game was released on Tuesday, despite approving _Horses_ for sale on the Epic Games Store weeks earlier. “Once again, no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines,” the studio [wrote in an FAQ](https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17). “Our appeal was denied twelve hours later without further explanation.”

According to an email from Epic that Santa Ragione shared, the company banned _Horses_ from its store due to violations of its inappropriate content and hateful or abusive content policies, the latter of which “prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.” It also determined that _Horses_ had received an adults-only rating, and such games aren’t allowed on its store. Engadget has contacted Epic for comment.

_Horses_ is a horror game about a college student who works on a farm during the summer. The farm’s so-called horses are actually nude human adults who wear equine masks and live as horses.

Santa Ragione said that, in its appeal to Epic, it pointed out that _Horses_ is a “strong critique of violence and abuse in general” and that it doesn’t promote any kind of abuse. It claimed that there are no “explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior,” as nudity is pixelated and although the three-hour game has four “sexual sequences,” these are brief and censored, with two mainly taking place off-camera. However, Santa Ragione said Epic stuck by its decision to block the game from its store.

With _Horses_ being banned from Steam and the Epic Games Store, that leaves [GOG](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=GOG.com&linkText=GOG&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2cuY29tL2VuL2dhbWUvaG9yc2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MzI1ZWIzZS01Yzg3LTQxODUtOGMzMC00NzBlN2E3MTA1MmIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZy5jb20vZW4vZ2FtZS9ob3JzZXMifQ&signature=AQAAAcBHcV4luXqAdeOgNDWroOc6HB_Dh9uJzNWQioGwKSOY&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhorses) (where it’s currently at the top of the bestsellers chart) and [Itch](https://santaragione.itch.io/horses)[.io](https://santaragione.itch.io/horses) as the only storefronts on which the $5 game is available as Santa Ragione tries to recoup the $100,000 or so it spent on development. _Horses_ was supposed to have been available via the Humble Store as well but, as [_Gamespot_](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/) notes, the [URL for the list](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Humble+Bundle&linkText=URL+for+the+list&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODMyNWViM2UtNWM4Ny00MTg1LThjMzAtNDcwZTdhNzEwNTJiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyJ9&signature=AQAAAdcydtCtVVRCKdMDiyz6t81Y2XNf9LZKy0y08TfLOK9v&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhorses)[ing](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=8325eb3e-5c87-4185-8c30-470e7a71052b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Humble+Bundle&linkText=ing&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODMyNWViM2UtNWM4Ny00MTg1LThjMzAtNDcwZTdhNzEwNTJiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5odW1ibGVidW5kbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2hvcnNlcyJ9&signature=AQAAAdcydtCtVVRCKdMDiyz6t81Y2XNf9LZKy0y08TfLOK9v&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhorses) now redirects to the store’s homepage.
