YouTube channel [_Hardware Unboxed_](https://www.youtube.com/@Hardwareunboxed) is reporting that NVIDIA has “effectively” discontinued the [RTX 5070 Ti](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-5070-ti-review-a-sensible-4k-powerhouse-for-749-140023082.html) and [5060 Ti 16GB](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-a-solid-semi-budget-gpu-for-429-but-good-luck-scoring-that-price-130058124.html) due to the ongoing memory crunch. In its [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE), the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it.

_Hardware Unboxed_ also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year. The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well," with ASUS stating it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to produce in the current economic climate. And while there might be some hope of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB returning later this year, the channel suggests both are unlikely to make a comeback. NVIDIA will reportedly focus on 8GB models like the [RTX 5050](https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7), [5060, and 5060 Ti 8GB](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-starts-at-299-rtx-5060-ti-at-379-130020340.html), with the 12GB [5070](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-basically-a-4070-ti-thats-better-at-4k-140016718.html) set to stick around for now. The 5080 and 5090 are seemingly safe as well, as more expensive, higher margin models, they offer more space for manufacturers to absorb component price increases.

NVIDIA did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. We’re also waiting to hear back from ASUS. We’ll update this article when the companies respond.

The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer [RAM kits](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business), [GPUs](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html) and SSDs. In December, Micron Technology announced it would [wind down its consumer-facing Crucial brand](https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html) to focus exclusively on providing components to the AI industry.

ASUS is the first of NVIDIA’s add-in board (AIB) partners to comment on the memory crunch. AIBs are the companies that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy from NVIDIA and AMD. Historically, NVIDIA has provided its board partners with both the GPU die and memory needed to make a graphics cards. However, a [recent rumor](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-reportedly-no-longer-supplying-vram-to-its-gpu-board-partners-in-response-to-memory-crunch-rumor-claims-vendors-will-only-get-the-die-forced-to-source-memory-on-their-own) suggested the company told partners they would need to start sourcing memory on their own.

If this is in fact the demise of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB, it’s sad news for PC enthusiasts. Many modern AAA games demand more than 8GB of VRAM, making the 16GB GPUs from both NVIDIA and AMD the ones you want to buy if you’re building a new system or upgrading your current rig.
