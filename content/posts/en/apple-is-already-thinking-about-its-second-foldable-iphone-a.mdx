We may not have a concrete release date for the [first foldable iPhone](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-design-130000516.html), but Apple may already be looking into a smaller device that will follow it up. According to [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold)'s Mark Gurman, Apple is exploring a "square, clamshell-style foldable phone," with the caveat that this potential device is "far from guaranteed to reach the market" and only "under consideration" right now.

If this eventually leads to a smaller foldable iPhone, that means Apple believes it can compete against existing options on the market, including Samsung's latest [Galaxy Z Flip 7](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review-140022250.html) and Motorola's revamped [Razr foldable](https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-2023-review-a-midrange-foldable-that-underwhelms-190025514.html). Gurman's report also signaled that Apple may be very optimistic about the success of its first [foldable iPhone](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-design-130000516.html), which is rumored to be released sometime later this year, and wants to have follow-up plans ready to capitalize on the potential demand generated.

It's not the first time that we've heard of a [clamshell foldable iPhone](https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-reportedly-made-foldable-iphone-prototypes-152804263.html), since a previous report from _The Information_ revealed that Apple created prototypes in this form factor. On the other end of the spectrum, Gurman's _Power On_ newsletter mentioned that Apple is considering a larger foldable that opens like a book. Previously, Gurman said that Apple considered a foldable that's more akin to the size of an iPad. However, the company ran into issues developing such a large device and may be delaying a [potential launch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-s-planned-foldable-ipad-with-18-inch-screen-hits-development-snags) to 2029, according to Gurman.
