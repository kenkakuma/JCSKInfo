During its [State of Play](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-playstation-state-of-play-of-2026-will-air-on-february-12-145747775.html) livestream on Thursday, Sony revealed the first PlayStation Plus Game Catalog addition for February and it's a doozy. [_Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_](https://www.engadget.com/marvels-spider-man-2-review-the-rare-game-thats-both-bigger-and-better-140002497.html) (PS5) will finally websling its way onto the Game Catalog on February 17.

_Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_ was released in October 2023, and Insomniac's third Spidey game is the the best of the bunch. You can play as both Peter Parker and his protégé Miles Morales. Each Spidey has his own skill tree and moveset to master.

Traversing New York (with a lot more of it explorable than in previous entries) has never felt better thanks to the addition of the wingsuit, while the set pieces are frequently breathtaking. _Marvel’s Spider-Man 2_ remains one of the PS5’s flagship games, and with _Marvel’s Spider-Man: Remastered_ and [_Miles Morales_](https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html) already on the Game Catalog, Extra and Premium subscribers can now play the whole series while they wait for Insomniac's [_Wolverine_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/marvels-wolverine-slices-his-way-onto-ps5-in-fall-2026-220250305.html) game to arrive later this year.

Sony later revealed the full PS Plus Game Catalog lineup for February on the [PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/). It includes _Neva_ (PS4 and PS5), a stunning 2D platformer that's pretty much an interactive fairytale. Engadget’s Jessica Conditt opened her [review](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neva-review-a-platformer-thats-so-perfect-it-made-me-cry-160037311.html) of the game by saying she had "absolutely nothing negative to say" about it, which is surely about as effusive as a recommendation can get. (A paid expansion that acts as a prequel is on the way next week too.)

The other titles coming to the PS Plus Game Catalog on February 17 are:

*   _Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown_ (PS5)
    
*   _Season: A Letter to the Future_ (PS4 and PS5)
    
*   _Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin_ (PS4)
    
*   _Monster Hunter Stories_ (PS4)
    
*   _Venba_ (PS5)
    
*   _Echoes of the End: Enhanced Edition_ (PS5)
    
*   _Rugby 25_ (PS4 and PS5)
    

PS Plus Premium members will have an extra game to play on PS4 and PS5 in the form of _Disney Pixar Wall-E_. This version was originally released in 2008 for the PlayStation 2.

Looking further ahead, _Tekken Dark Resurrection_ will be available to Premium subscribers in March. Premium members will be able to play the original _Time Crisis_ on their PS5 with gyro controls in May, which sounds fun. Also, [_Big Walk_](https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html), a multiplayer game from _Untitled Goose Game_ developer House House, will be available on all three PS Plus tiers when it debuts later this year.

**Update February 12, 6:43PM ET:** Added the full list of PS Plus Game Catalog titles for February.
