Now that the winter holidays are well and truly past, now's the perfect time to take stock of your tech setup. If you were gifted (or gifted yourself) some new gear in December, make sure that you've got the proper accessories to keep that gear performing at its best. If a new way to power all those batteries would be a benefit, Amazon's currently running a discount on an excellent wireless charging pad. The [UGREEN MagFlow Qi2 3-in-1 Charger Station 25W](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DZX533Y1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=3cc4c398-0e79-409e-bf43-095a0740d354&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=UGREEN+MagFlow+Qi2+3-in-1+Charger+Station+25W&custData=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&signature=AQAAAWIQDHIFYcRRFisJaeLgkmoFZFCwXZh3WokbDFQAfnwc&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Foldable-Wireless-Ultra-Compact-Pocket-Size%2Fdp%2FB0DZX533Y1%2Fref%3Dast_sto_dp_puis) is on sale for $95. That's only a little bit above the lowest price we've ever seen for the product (which was $90), and it's still a 32 percent discount off its usual cost.

This is [our top pick](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html) for a 3-in-1 charging pad thanks to its versatility. The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product. The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There's also a dedicated part of the pad's design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you'll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.
