Artificial intelligence is showing up everywhere in Google's services these days, whether or not people want them and sometimes in places where they really don't make a lick of sense. The latest trial from Google appears to be giving articles the AI treatment in Google Discover. [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/835839/google-discover-ai-headlines-clickbait-nonsense) noticed that some articles were being displayed in Google Discover with AI-generated headlines different from the ones in the original posts. And to the surprise of absolutely no one, some of these headlines are misleading or flat-out wrong. 

For instance, one rewritten headline claimed "Steam Machine price revealed," but the _Ars Technica_ [article's](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valves-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-dont-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one/) actual headline was "Valve's Steam Machine looks like a console, but don’t expect it to be priced like one." No costs have been shared yet for the hardware, either in that post or elsewhere from Valve. In our own explorations, _Engadget_ staff also found that Discover was providing original headlines accompanied by AI-generated summaries. In both cases, the content is tagged as "Generated with AI, which can make mistakes." But it sure would be nice if the company just didn't use AI at all in this situation and thus avoided the mistakes entirely.

The instances _The Verge_ found were apparently "a small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users," Google rep Mallory Deleon told the publication. "We are testing a new design that changes the placement of existing headlines to make topic details easier to digest before they explore links from across the web." That sounds innocuous enough, but Google has a history of hostility towards online media its frequent role as middleman between publishers and readers. Web publishers have made multiple attempts over the years to get compensation from Google for displaying portions of their content, and in at least [two](https://www.engadget.com/google-a-197-trillion-company-is-protesting-californias-plan-to-pay-journalists-175706632.html) [instances](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/a-google-test-will-omit-eu-publishers-from-news-links-184536615.html), Google has responded by cutting out those sources from search results and later [claiming](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-says-its-european-experiment-shows-news-is-worthless-to-its-ad-business-161103352.html) that showing news doesn't do much for the bottom line of its ad business. 

For those of you who do in fact want more AI in your Google Search experience, you're in luck. AI Mode, the chatbot that's already been called outright ["theft"](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/newsmedia-alliance-calls-googles-ai-mode-theft-223128521.html) by the News Media Alliance, is getting an even more symbiotic integration into the mobile search platform. Google Search's Vice President of Product Robby Stein [posted](https://x.com/rmstein/status/1995572911093289055) yesterday on X that the company is testing having AI Mode accessible on the same screen as an AI Overview rather than the two services existing in separate tabs.
