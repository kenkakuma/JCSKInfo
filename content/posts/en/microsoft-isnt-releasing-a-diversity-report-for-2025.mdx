Microsoft will not release a diversity and inclusion report for 2025 like it has been doing every year [since 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-microsoft-diversity-report-2019.html), Stephen Totilo from [_Game File_ has reported](https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-skips-diversity-inclusion-report-2025). Totilo asked the company if it was skipping this year after it failed to publish a report from October to early November like it had done so the previous years. “We are not doing a traditional report this year as we’ve evolved beyond that to formats that are more dynamic and accessible — stories, videos, and insights that show inclusion in action,” said Microsoft’s chief communications officer, Frank Shaw, in a statement. “Our mission and commitment to our culture and values remain unchanged: empowering every person and organization to achieve more.”

As Totilo notes, the Trump administration made it very clear early on that it was against government and corporate diversity, equality and inclusion programs. Trump [signed executive orders](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2025/02/10/president-trump-acts-to-roll-back-dei-initiatives/) directing government agencies to roll back DEI initiatives and encouraged the private sector to do the same. [Meta](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-right-wing-reinvention-also-includes-an-end-to-dei-programs-and-trans-messenger-themes-204031848.html) reportedly ended its DEI programs earlier this year, while [Google](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-reportedly-changing-course-on-its-diversity-initiatives-too-223644402.html) reportedly announced that it will “no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce.”

Totilo previously reported that Microsoft didn’t mention anything about its diversity programs in two shareholder reports for 2025, signifying that the company wasn’t highlighting its DEI initiatives anymore like it did the previous years. Based on its statement, Microsoft isn’t completely dropping its DEI efforts. Without a report, however, we can’t keep an eye on its progress when it comes to things like pay equality and workforce diversity.
