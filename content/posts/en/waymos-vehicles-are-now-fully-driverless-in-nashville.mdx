Waymo has gotten a step closer to offering robotaxi rides to the public in Nashville, Tennessee. The company the city and making sure they can operate as fully autonomous rides before launching a paid service in the location. Waymo [announced](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-is-headed-to-nashville-in-2026-140807997.html) that it was planning to bring its robotaxis to Nashville in September 2025, with the intention opening up rides to the public sometime this year. The company has been testing its technology in Nashville since then, but it has yet say when it’ll start accepting bookings for rides.

The company conducts extensive testing in every new city before deploying its robotaxi service. It starts by having safety drivers map the area and then updating its software with information learned from those tests, since each city has its own driving rules and conditions. Despite its testing, Waymo has had to issue a software recall several times in the past after its vehicles malfunctioned when faced with real hazards on the road. Its vehicles were previously seeing hitting gates, chains, [telephone poles](https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issues-recall-after-one-its-self-driving-taxis-crashed-into-a-pole-121937607.html) and [stationary vehicles](https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issued-a-recall-after-two-robotaxis-crashed-into-the-same-pickup-truck-055708611.html). Most recently, it issued a recall because its robotaxis [failed to stop](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-robotaxi-fleet-is-being-recalled-again-this-time-for-failing-to-stop-for-school-buses-190222243.html) for school buses.

At the moment, Waymo vehicles are already open to the public in [Los Angeles](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-driverless-cars-will-start-driving-on-freeways-in-three-us-cities-171654775.html), San Francisco, [Miami](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-is-now-available-in-miami-162515070.html) and Phoenix, as well as in [Atlanta](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-uber-launch-robotaxi-service-in-atlanta-110056091.html) and [Austin](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-ubers-austin-robotaxi-expansion-begins-today-120035908.html) through a partnership with Uber. It’s active in a lot more locations, including [New York](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-can-now-test-its-self-driving-vehicles-in-new-york-city-150015938.html), New Orleans, [Seattle](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-next-stops-for-its-robotaxis-are-denver-and-seattle-225125605.html) and even [Tokyo, Japan](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-will-start-testing-its-self-driving-taxis-in-tokyo-next-week-163016736.html), but it’s not serving riders in those locations yet. Nashville is in the list of new locations where Waymo is conducting or planning to conduct driverless trials, along with Boston, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington and [London, UK](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-plans-to-launch-fully-autonomous-taxi-service-in-london-next-year-142453250.html).
