Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. There are tons of interesting games out this week. But first, there's been some discourse around the Nintendo Switch version of _Dispatch_, which arrived this week as well.

On other platforms, there's an option to censor genitalia and other explicit content, but that's not present in the Switch version. Instead, such content is censored by default, with black rectangles [covering up characters' bits](https://www.nintendo-insider.com/dispatch-switch-2-review/) and someone flipping the bird. Noises that suggest sexual pleasure are said to be toned down too.

"We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release," developer AdHoc told [_EuroGamer_](https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment). Nintendo later said in a statement to [_GoNintendo_](https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much) that it "requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations." 

There are other games available for the Switch and Switch 2 that feature nudity and explicit content. There have long been hentai games on the eShop, while mainstream games like _The Witcher 3_ and _Cyberpunk 2077_ ([we know all about the dongs in that one](https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-glitch-penis-breasts-170449946.html)) still include explicit content on Nintendo platforms. So it's a bit of a strange one, and AdHoc and Nintendo didn't exactly clear things up with their statements.

There's been speculation that AdHoc censored the game to comply with rules in Japan (_Cyberpunk 2077_ is [censored there](https://www.pcgamer.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-cyberpunk-2077-will-be-censored-in-japan/) too) and that it opted to have just one version of the game available globally on Nintendo platforms. All the same, it's a curious situation that's resulted in a lot of discourse. But there's been another indie game that's been a source of even more chatter this week...

## New releases

_Highguard_ is a 3v3 raid shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a team that includes a bunch of former _Apex Legends_ and _Titanfall_ developers. It [broke cover at The Game Awards](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/everything-announced-and-all-the-winners-at-the-game-awards-2025-044101761.html) in December when it was the final reveal of the night but that first trailer wasn't great.

[As it turned out](https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137), TGA creator and host Geoff Keighley was a friend of the devs and after trying _Highguard_, he wanted to include it in the show. Wildlight cobbled together a trailer, but that disrupted the studio's long-standing plans to reveal and release the game simultaneously — a [strategy](https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-04-apex-legends-battle-royale-game-now-available-respawn-titanfall.html) that worked wonders for _Apex Legends_ (though that game had the might of EA behind it).

After revealing _Highguard_, Wildlight effectively went radio silent until a release day showcase on Monday to detail just what the game is and how it works. That seems to have been a mistake given the [review bombing](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/highguard-deserves-a-chance-so-dont-kill-it-out-of-spite/) and strange vendetta some developed against it. _Highguard_ went live on Monday and Wildlight published a whole bunch of YouTube videos revealing the game's features. Spreading those out between TGA and this week could have tempered expectations.

In any case, I've played a few rounds of _Highguard_ and mostly enjoyed my time with it so far. It's a blend of hero shooter and MOBA. As you might expect for a game from _Apex_ and _Titanfall_ veterans, the weapons feel well-tuned and the gunplay is snappy. There’s a lot going on and the maps are far too big for just six players. It's fun enough, but I don't think it's a game that's going to break my _Overwatch_ obsession. Riding into battle on the back of a bear feels pretty great, though. You can play _Highguard_ for free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UB0704-PPSA25022_00-NC10000000000000) and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=462b5557-20ab-4878-be7c-f25feceae428&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9oaWdoZ3VhcmQvOW1zcWxyYjVobm01IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NjJiNTU1Ny0yMGFiLTQ4NzgtYmU3Yy1mMjVmZWNlYWU0MjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL2hpZ2hndWFyZC85bXNxbHJiNWhubTUifQ&signature=AQAAAbSo1wI803sPKzI_VfRl93916T1z6GpQpT3JWZB4Ehpb&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fhighguard%2F9msqlrb5hnm5).

I really wanted to like [_Don’t Stop, Girlypop!_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/incolatus-dont-stop-girlypop-may-be-the-y2k-fever-dream-arena-shooter-you-never-knew-you-needed-182348483.html) more than I did. I'd been looking forward to it for a while, as the promise of a _Doom Eternal_\-style arena shooter with chaotic hyperpop-inspired visuals seemed like a great blend. Don't get me wrong, I adore the aesthetic and the [soundtrack is spot on](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mF74NpmUZtb7rObZmM9t_zXYmA06Ojn1k) thanks to some cracking songs from Sarah Wolfe, Xavier Dunn and Candice Susnjar. I just wish it was as fun to play as it is to look at and listen to.

The visual clutter and fast pace sometimes makes it hard to spot enemies and the narrative doesn't really hang together, as much as the developers have salient points to make about the exploitation of finite resources. The core gameplay idea here is that the faster you move, the more damage you deal and more you heal. The game has its own take on a bunny hop called a wave hop that boosts your speed, but felt like it slowed me down because of the complex combination of inputs (jump, ground pound, jump, dash). That also caused my hand to cramp up very quickly. 

I do love the customization here. Slapping rhinestones and baby sharks onto my weapons was delightful. The game's take on a gravity gun is fun too. So while _Don't Stop, Girlypop!_ — from Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee — didn't fully land for me, there are some aspects I like a whole lot. It's out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/) for $20 (there's a 10 percent launch discount until February 5).

We're been looking forward to [_Cairn_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cairns-new-release-date-is-january-29-2026-211508330.html) for a while around these parts, so it's heartening to see that it debuted to broadly [positive](https://gameinformer.com/review/cairn/the-price-of-persistence) [reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/29/cairn-review-obsession-suffering-and-awe-in-a-climbing-game-that-hits-exhausting-new-heights). This one from The Game Bakers is the latest in a string of climbing adventures, such as the lovely _Jusant_. So if Alex Honnold's recent [free solo climb](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/climbing-game-cairn-will-have-a-free-solo-mode-with-no-rope-213450638.html) up a skyscraper has inspired you to ascend something very large without really posing a risk to your wellbeing, _Cairn_ might be what you're looking for. 

_Cairn_ is out now on [PS5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/cairn/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/) for $30. There's a 10 percent launch discount on Steam until February 12, and until February 13 on PS5 if you're a PS Plus member.

Every trailer I've seen for [_Steel Century Groove_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/silksong-smacking-sticks-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110020156.html) has made me smile, so you can bet I'll be jumping into this when I have a chance. It's a rhythm game with Pokémon-style RPG elements in which you take control of a robot in dance battles. There's some original and licensed music to boogie along to and you can load in your own MP3s (you can bank on me loading some Electric Callboy tracks into this game). _Steel Century Groove_ will create procedurally-generated choreography and charts for your custom songs. You can manually adjust the BPM too.

This debut title from solo developer Sloth Gloss Games is [out now on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/) for $20. There's a 10 percent launch discount until February 11. There's a demo available, and progress from there carries over into the full game.

Rosday's _Wanderling_ is a roguelike platformer with no combat. You have eight attempts to acquire the gear and learn the knowledge you need to pass each dungeon. Scour for loot and buy upgrades from the shop before night falls to help you on your way. You can place markers to help you remember where you've been. 

Runs are said to be short at between 20 and 30 minutes. The visuals remind me a bit of _Celeste_ too. You can check out _Wanderling_ on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2859530/Wanderling/) now for $8 (a 10 percent discount brings the price down to $7.20 until February 2).

I can't help but admire Strange Scaffold ([_Clickolding_](https://www.engadget.com/clickolding-from-the-i-am-your-beast-devs-looks-like-a-clicking-nightmare-180504296.html)_, I Am Your Beast, Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking_) and the rate at which it releases games. The latest one is _Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator_. 

It's a stock market sim in which you speculate on the future success or failures of the "simulated lives of babies." You can "short that baby" if you choose as you try to make gains. In a timeline where prediction markets allow you to speculate on just about anything (listen to [this week's episode of the Engadget Podcast](https://www.engadget.com/general/engadget-podcast-what-do-prediction-markets-like-kalshi-cost-us-143113799.html) to learn more about that), gambling on the future of babies doesn't seem that farfetched.

_Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator_ — which is set in the same world as _Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator_ — is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/). It'll normally cost $20, but there's a 15 percent discount until February 12. Strange Scaffold is also bringing the game to Xbox Series X/S in the near future.

_I Hate This Place_ is an isometric survival game based on the eponymous comic book series by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin. The game retains a comic book aesthetic and it has '80s horror movie-style inflections.

The way that noise is visualized is pretty interesting here. Onomatopoeic words will pop up and you'll see color-coded footsteps — useful when you're trying to be stealthy. Crafting is a key aspect of the game as well.

_I Hate This Place_ — from Rock Square Thunder, Broken Mirror Games and Skybound Entertainment — is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/), [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10017830), [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/i-hate-this-place-switch/) and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=462b5557-20ab-4878-be7c-f25feceae428&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xbox&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi11cy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9pLWhhdGUtdGhpcy1wbGFjZS85UDlON1ZHMkJGNTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ2MmI1NTU3LTIwYWItNDg3OC1iZTdjLWYyNWZlY2VhZTQyOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvaS1oYXRlLXRoaXMtcGxhY2UvOVA5TjdWRzJCRjUzIn0&signature=AQAAASjlcGZiLZ7OyjmqMYAtJJEpt_xiuDb7G0eNm_8nO8jY&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fi-hate-this-place%2F9P9N7VG2BF53). The regular price is $30 and there's a 20 percent launch discount on some platforms. 

I can't find a trailer for this on YouTube, unfortunately, but [_Rebadge_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4080840/REBADGE/) caught my eye this week as well. It's a puzzle platformer from Yuumayay, who appears to be a 17-year-old solo developer. Your character carries badges that allow them to carry out actions like moving and jumping. Other badges include "affected by gravity" and "destroys on contact." Here's the trick: you can throw a badge and lose the associated ability, but then you can apply the trait to something else in the world.

It's a neat idea that draws from the playbooks of games like _Baba Is You_. _Rebadge_ typically costs $8, but there's a 15 percent launch discount.

## Upcoming 

Moon Beast Productions is a studio formed by several of the creators of _Diablo_ and _Diablo II_. This week, it revealed gameplay for its first title, _Darkhaven_, which is a fantasy isometric action RPG in the vein of (you guessed it) Diablo. You'll be able to play this one solo or with friends, and there are PvP elements. _Darkhaven_ has procedurally generated, destructible worlds along with "massive events that threaten your entire world."

The gameplay shown in the trailer looks a bit rough, but it's still early days. In fact, Moon Beast is planning a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds) for _Darkhaven_. There's no release window as yet, but you can wishlist it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/).

_Box or Void_ is a puzzle game that clearly takes some inspiration from _Sokuban_ and _Snake._ Here, though, gameplay takes place across two planes. You'll switch between positive and negative space — obstacles on one side turn into pathways on the other. You'll alter the level layouts by pushing boxes. 

This one from Dumen Games has an intriguing premise. There's no release date as yet for _Box or Void_, but a demo with 32 levels (about a fifth of what will be in the full game) [dropped this week on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3878040/Box_or_Void/).

If there's a game that's billed as _Dredge_ meets _Wall-E_, that's going to be enough to sell me. Describe it as a "petroidvania" and call it _Good Boy_, and I'm definitely in.

This is a creature-collecting Metroidvania from Observer Interactive and publisher Team17 in which pups are reincarnated as space rovers. I could not dig that premise more. [_Good Boy_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986110/Good_Boy/) is expected to hit Steam later this year.
