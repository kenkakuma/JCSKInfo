We have compiled [all the best gear](https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html) with our highest review scores in each category, after thousands of hours of testing. We’ve got the Switch 2, AirPods Pro 3 and DJI’s top drone for most of you. Anecdotally, Anker’s Laptop Power Bank, with two built-in charging cables, has been the sleeper hit of the Engadget team, with four editors making it their power bank of choice. I think it’s the retractable cable.

### Some use locally stored data, and others let you organize Apple Music songs.

OpenAI has introduced an app directory right inside ChatGPT. The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) divides into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and even websites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox.

OpenAI says developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to a native app or website, but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well.

### Who wouldn’t want to overpay for an old phone?

Peanuts

It’s the wildcard news story no one saw coming. Sony, of Walkman and PlayStation fame, is buying an 80 percent stake of Peanuts for a cool $460 million. Sony already bought 39 percent of the franchise back in 2018 — something most of us were entirely unaware of.
