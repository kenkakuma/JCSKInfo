This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, across all four colorways, but the [512GB model is also down to $949](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DZD89BFV&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6fff181c-d5f2-4e5f-8daf-ad7b81fb0f93&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=512GB+model+is+also+down+to+%24949&custData=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&signature=AQAAAWWBpsuQvS0zpHcO4nDapGPf9yu85QKO4w56nxPdThmz&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0DZD89BFV%2F) — another all-time low versus the Apple Store price of $1,199.

The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go.

Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.

The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support.

Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger.

There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price.
