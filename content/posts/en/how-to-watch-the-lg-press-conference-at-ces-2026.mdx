LG

For years, LG has kicked off CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no different. The Korea-based corporation is theming its presentation as "[Innovation in Tune with You](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d6eb7981-0913-4e7b-bd66-4bc9abdcb17b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LG+Electronics&linkText=Innovation+in+Tune+with+You&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vc2cvYWJvdXQtbGcvcHJlc3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2xnLXRvLXNob3djYXNlLWlubm92YXRpb24taW4tdHVuZS13aXRoLXlvdS1hdC1jZXMtMjAyNi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ2ZWI3OTgxLTA5MTMtNGU3Yi1iZDY2LTRiYzlhYmRjYjE3YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3NnL2Fib3V0LWxnL3ByZXNzLWFuZC1tZWRpYS9sZy10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWluLXR1bmUtd2l0aC15b3UtYXQtY2VzLTIwMjYvIn0&signature=AQAAAcG6Rd6QemxPUL1eIW_tJUMP_5M5-h8dpsAxNuC167Oc&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fsg%2Fabout-lg%2Fpress-and-media%2Flg-to-showcase-innovation-in-tune-with-you-at-ces-2026%2F)," and — if it follows the template of past presentations — it will highlight both the consumer electronics and large appliance sides of its mammoth global businesses.

Like nearly all tech-centric events these days, expect AI to be the binding theme of the LG presentation at [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html). Just be aware that, like Apple, LG has its own customized abbreviation for AI: "Affectionate Intelligence." The company will share "its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences." In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever. Here's how you can stream it and what you can expect.

## What to expect

Here's what LG has already confirmed it will be showcasing at CES 2026:
