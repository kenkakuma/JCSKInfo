After taking a break from the [Playdate](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-playdate-games-190049201.html) following Season Two and the wonderfully weird experience that was [_Blippo+_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blippo-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-and-pc-in-color-september-23-160014279.html), I finally dusted off my little yellow console this week and dove back in. And what better place to start than with a couple of games about cheese? [_Cheese 'n Crackers_](https://play.date/games/cheese-n-crackers/) and [_Say When!_](https://play.date/games/say-when/??utm_campaign=Nov2025) both hit the Playdate Catalog recently, but aside from the thematic similarity, they're two very different games. As an extra treat (unrelated to cheese), I also picked up [_Ware-wolf Campfire Stories_](https://ledbetter-games.itch.io/ware-wolf), a free game on [](http://itch.io)itch.io that's actually over a dozen bite-sized games in one. 

## _Cheese 'n Crackers_

When it comes to snacking, everyone's got their preferences. Some crave a savory blast of umami, while for others, a sweet treat might be what always hits the spot. Or maybe you're like me, and if you have one, it needs to be followed by the other. Creating snacks that hit _just right_ is what [_Cheese 'n Crackers_](https://play.date/games/cheese-n-crackers/) is all about. 

In this Playdate game, you have what is essentially a neverending charcuterie board with all the fixins you could imagine. There are meats, cheeses, spreads, spices, vegetables, fruits and various types of crackers and breads to adorn with those toppings. You have to combine ingredients to make the perfect snacks for whatever group you're serving that round. Each group — like the Speed Daters or Grandma's Bridge Club — has a specific set of guidelines that may include favorites, dietary restrictions or aversions to certain tastes.

Scenic Route Software

While pairing ingredients is pretty intuitive, there are specific combinations that will earn you more points, so you'll have to pay attention to descriptions of each food item. Or, you can turn to the [_Cheese 'n Crackers_ Compatibility Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vICZNLunQQbQuezRSF9biEf4lkQi544q-4H9j7QMupw/edit?gid=945471349#gid=945471349) for all of that information in one place. Yes, that exists, and it's an intimidating work of culinary organization. Toppings will go bad if they sit out for too long, so you won't want to waste too much time scouring the spreadsheet, but it's still a relatively low-pressure game that you can play at your own pace. For the more competitive among us, though, there are leaderboards so you can challenge yourself with scores to beat. 

## _Say When!_

This is the more intense of our cheese games, with a [_Root Bear_](https://www.engadget.com/i-finally-understand-the-hype-around-the-playdate-game-root-bear-002037850.html)_\-_like structure that sees you tending to a revolving door of restaurant patrons and trying to grate the perfect amount of cheese for their meals using the crank. And despite being called [_Say When!_](https://play.date/games/say-when/??utm_campaign=Nov2025), your customers (very _un_helpfully) will not actually say "when" to let you know you can stop cranking; you have to pay attention to their unique tells to know when they're satisfied — the twitch of a mustache, a change in facial expression, etc.

Smashtoad Studios

There's a customer satisfaction meter at the top of the screen that will take hits any time you under- or over-serve cheese, or suffer if you're moving too slowly, and once it's down to the bottom, you're fired. After each shift, you'll be given the choice to use a modifier that can help you out in areas like customer satisfaction or getting the boss off your back. To mix things up, there are also mini-games that pop up in the middle of your shift. You might be furiously grating cheese and then have to switch gears and save the life of a choking customer, for example. 

It's fast-paced, it's silly and it's pretty hard to put down once you get going. 

## _Ware-wolf Campfire Stories_

While the Playdate Catalog has lots of great titles to choose from, there are plenty of gems _not_ on there that are worth checking out too. One such example is [_Ware-wolf Campfire Stories_](https://ledbetter-games.itch.io/ware-wolf), a unique package of 14 tiny games that's free on [](http://itch.io)itch.io. It's the result of a collaboration between 15 developer teams — including the developers of _Off-Planet Dreams_, the Life's Too Short series, _Voidblazers_ and other popular Playdate titles.

Per the description:

> In _Ware-wolf Campfire Stories,_ 5 kids are sitting around a fire with their counselor telling spoooooky tales! Each story launches a separate game that you may win or lose.... with consequences.

It's a cool format, and there's some nice variety among the games, which each only take a few minutes to get through for the most part. They're all of the spooky sort, so expect bats, ghosts and skeletons galore. It's a nice way to get a taste of some of the many different game styles you'll encounter on the Playdate, and maybe discover some developers whose games you haven't yet checked out.
