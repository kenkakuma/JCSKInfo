[Rivian](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-unveils-a-new-quad-motor-r1-variant-180333764.html)'s electric mobility spinoff Also announced a $3,500 starting price for its first e-bike called the TM-B. The startup unveiled the [shapeshifting e-bike](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-first-e-bike-from-rivian-spinoff-also-has-a-virtual-drivetrain-173000250.html) last month, with options for a limited Launch edition, a Performance version or a base model. During the reveal, Also said both the Launch and Performance TM-B models would start at $4,500, but only hinted at the base model's price tag being less than $4,000.

While the base model TM-B is more than $1,000 cheaper than the other choices, it comes with several compromises, like a lower max range of 60 miles, a weaker 5x power assist, coil fork suspension and only a standard ride mode. In comparison, the higher-end TM-B options have up to a 100-mile range, a 10x power assist, air fork suspension and the choice between sport and standard ride modes. Also is only offering the base model TM-B in all gray, meaning you won't get the transparent shell that highlights the virtual drivetrain called DreamRide.

While the TM-B's starting price is more affordable than we first thought, it's still a premium price tag for an e-bike. The TM-B base model is [available for preorder](https://ridealso.com/products/tm-b-reservation) with a $50 refundable deposit and will start shipping in late 2026, according to Also.
