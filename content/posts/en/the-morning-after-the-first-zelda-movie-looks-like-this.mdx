While unofficial videos from filming _The Legend of Zelda_ hit the internet first, Nintendo also unveiled the first images of its live-action project. One photo shows Link and Zelda amid the hills of New Zealand — if you’ve got characters with Elven ears, you have to film in NZ.

As Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham notes, Zelda appears with a bow and quiver, so hopefully it’s a more modern spin than the damsel-in-distress original. I mean, the game is _named_ for her. Filming has just started, so this is all we have until a proper trailer arrives.

DJI’s latest drone — and it’s hard to keep track — is the Neo 2. It’s a relatively inexpensive, lightweight model for creators and hobbyists, and it’s loaded with new features, like LiDAR obstacle detection, improved video quality, and longer battery life. Gesture control is a major new Neo 2 feature that isn’t on other DJI drones. Wave a hand up, down or sideways to climb and bank, move two hands apart or together to make it approach or move away, clench a fist to stop it and hold out your palm to land. Like a bird! Manual flight controls on your smartphone is another new feature not on other DJI drones. It’s also only slightly more expensive than its predecessor.

## [Meta and Google delay undersea cables over security concerns](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-and-google-delay-undersea-cables-over-security-concerns-163508037.html)

### It’s due to a lot of things, apparently.

Meta and Google are facing delays with long-promised undersea cable projects, according to a report by _Bloomberg_. A Meta spokesperson blames the delays on a “range of operational factors, regulatory concerns and geopolitical risk.” Meta’s 2Africa subsea cable system is designed to give fiber internet to the African continent. It’s also intended to connect Europe with Asia and Africa. The Google-backed Blue-Raman intercontinental cable system in the region has also been delayed, following its initial announcement in 2021. The company has not provided an updated timeline.
