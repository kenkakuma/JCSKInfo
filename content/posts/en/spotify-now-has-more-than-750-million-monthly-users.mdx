[Spotify announced Tuesday](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-10/spotify-q4-2025-earnings/) that it hit 751 million total monthly active users (MAUs) for quarter-four of 2025. That record-high is an 11 percent jump from the year before and a significant bump from the third quarter's 713 million MAUs. 

The quarterly earnings report also showed a 10 percent jump year-over-year in Premium subscribers, from 263 million to 290 million. Europe makes up the greatest number of the Swedish company's premium subscribers (36 percent), with North America coming second at 25 percent. 

Spotify contributes a few factors to its growth, including AI. "We consider ourselves the R&D department for the music industry. Our job is to understand new technologies quickly and capture their potential, which we’ve done time and again," Gustav Söderström, Co-CEO of Spotify, said in a statement. The entire industry stands to benefit from this \[AI\] paradigm shift but we believe those who embrace this change and move fast, will benefit the most.” In late 2025, Spotify announced it would get rid of some of the [AI "slop"](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html) on its platform and have "[artist-first AI music products](https://www.engadget.com/ai/spotify-partners-with-the-big-three-music-labels-on-artist-first-ai-music-products-161047159.html)" — though the specifics were very vague. 

The company also claims that [December's Spotify Wrapped](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html) was bigger than ever, with over 300 million engaged users and 630 million shares across 56 languages.
