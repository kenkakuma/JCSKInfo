Google announced Tuesday a landmark $15 billion investment to build India's largest artificial intelligence hub outside the United States, marking the tech giant's biggest commitment to the South Asian nation amid rising trade tensions with Washington.

The five-year project will establish a 1-gigawatt data center campus in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, integrating AI infrastructure with renewable energy capacity and international subsea cable connectivity. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian described it as "the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world outside of the United States".​

**Strategic Timing Amid Trade Tensions**

The announcement comes as U.S.-India relations face strain from President Trump's 50% tariffs on Indian imports imposed in August, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote "swadeshi" (made in India) products. Indian ministers have recently endorsed local alternatives including Zoho Corporation's services competing with Google Workspace and Gmail, WhatsApp-rival Arattai, and MapMyIndia as a Google Maps alternative.​

Despite this push for digital independence, Google's massive investment demonstrates India's continued appeal as a technology hub. The project received backing from key officials including Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who called it "a very important contribution to the India AI mission goals".​

**Infrastructure and Economic Impact**

The Visakhapatnam facility will feature Google's complete AI technology stack, including custom Tensor Processing Units and access to Gemini AI models. The hub will support consumer services like Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Ads while serving as a testbed for AI research across India.​

Google partnered with Indian telecom giant Bharti Airtel and Adani Group-backed AdaniConneX for infrastructure development. The project is expected to create over 100,000 jobs and generate approximately $15 billion in U.S. GDP through AI and cloud services between 2026 and 2030.​

The investment positions Visakhapatnam as a global connectivity hub through new international subsea cables, complementing existing gateways in Mumbai and Chennai. This infrastructure will enhance India's digital resilience while supporting the government's ambitious target of 6 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029.​
