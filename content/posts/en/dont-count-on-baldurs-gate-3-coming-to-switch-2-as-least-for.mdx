Nintendo Switch 2 owners can forget about seeing _Baldur’s Gate 3_ in the Nintendo Store, at least as of now. In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/), Larian Studio's CEO, [Swen Vicke](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6), said that the team would have loved to bring the title to Switch 2, but "it wasn't our decision to make."

As cryptic as that may sound, Vicke's response hints that either Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons and Dragons IP that _Baldur's Gate 3_ is set in, or Nintendo is behind the lack of a port. When it comes to Wizards of the Coast, [rumors](https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501?s=20) have circulated that the game studio and Wizards of the Coast may have a strained relationship. On the other hand, Larian Studios' technical director, [Bert van Semmertier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz), revealed in a response to another AMA question that the studio just released _Divinity: Original Sin 2_ on the Switch 2, adding that "we love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next Divinity game."

There's still a chance that Wizards of the Coast decides to hire another studio to pursue a port in the future, but there's been no indication yet. As for why [Larian Studios](https://www.engadget.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-confirms-it-wont-make-the-sequel-091930642.html) won't be behind a potential Switch 2 port, the developer said in a statement last year that it would no longer develop any major content updates or expansions for _Baldur's Gate 3_, nor work on a sequel.
