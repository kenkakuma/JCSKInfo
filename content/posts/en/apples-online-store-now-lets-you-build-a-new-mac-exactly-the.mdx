Just like buying a new iPhone through Apple's online store, you now select each spec of your new Mac device when purchasing through the website. As first spotted by [_MacWorld_](https://www.macworld.com/article/3048329/apple-just-completely-changed-how-you-buy-a-new-mac.html), Apple updated its [online configuration tool](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) for purchasing a Mac. Compared to the previous design that allowed you to pick between several prebuilt options, the new configurator lets you choose one spec after another instead.

It's not a major difference compared to choosing between preconfigured options, but interested buyers have more customization since they can select the color, display, chip, memory, storage and even power adapter. The updated page also gives customers the option to add pre-installed apps, like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro, to their new Mac.

The updated configuration design might hint towards the expected release of the upgraded MacBook Pros. According to [_MacWorld_](https://www.macworld.com/article/3030240/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-performance-speed-graphics-configurations.html), there are rumors that Apple will offer the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips with more flexibility that lets you choose how many CPU and GPU cores you want. As reported by [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold)'s Mark Gurman, the latest MacBook Pro could be queued up for a release alongside macOS 26.3, which has a release cycle between February and March.
