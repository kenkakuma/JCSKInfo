Losing [AirPods](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html) happens to the best of us. They’re small, they slide into couch cushions and they love disappearing into bags or pockets when you least expect it. Luckily, Apple’s [Find My](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109020) system makes it easy to track down misplaced AirPods, whether you dropped the case somewhere or can’t find one of the individual earbuds. With the right settings enabled, your iPhone can show the last place they were connected, play a sound to help you hunt them down or even guide you with on-screen directions. Here’s how to use Find My to locate lost AirPods and how to track down the left or right earbud if only one has gone missing.

## How to use Find My to locate AirPods

If your AirPods are paired with an Apple device linked to your Apple ID, they automatically appear in the Find My app. You don’t need to enable this manually, but you do need Bluetooth turned on during regular use so the system can refresh their location.

Open the **Find My app** on your iPhone, iPad or Mac and go to the **Devices** tab. Your AirPods should appear in the list. If they’re online or recently connected to your device, Find My will show their current location on a map. If they’re offline, the app will show the last place they were detected, which can help narrow down where to start searching.

For many people, this alone is enough to jog a memory. Find My might show your gym, a friend’s house or the bus stop where they slipped out of your pocket. If the location seems familiar, head there first and refresh the app once you arrive so it can update if the AirPods reconnect.

If Find My says your AirPods are nearby but you still can’t see them, you can make them play a locating sound. Tap **Play Sound** in the device menu and the earbuds will emit a rising chirp that gets louder over a few seconds. This is especially helpful for finding AirPods hiding under blankets, inside bags or behind furniture.

Keep in mind that AirPods need enough battery to make noise, and the charging case itself cannot play sound unless you have AirPods 4 (ANC), AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 that [support that feature](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/airpods/dev8e8b93d71/web). If nothing plays, try refreshing the app or checking the last location again.

AirPods models, like the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) and AirPods Pro (3rd gen) with MagSafe charging cases support Precision Finding. This feature uses the U1 chip inside your iPhone to show a directional arrow, distance estimate and haptic feedback as you get closer. Not all models have this feature, but if yours do, the Find My app will display a Find Nearby button.

Follow the on-screen prompts and slowly rotate your phone. The iPhone will show when you’re walking in the right direction and tell you when you’re close enough to start looking under cushions or inside drawers.

## How to locate individual AirPods

AirPods have a habit of separating from each other, and losing only the left or right earbud may happen as frequently as misplacing the entire case. One of the most useful features in Find My is the ability to track each earbud individually. Here’s how to do it:

*   Locate your AirPods in the Find My app and select the option to locate the **Left** or **Right** earbud.
    
*   Select the earbud that’s missing. The map will update to show its location. 
    
*   If the missing bud has nearby location support, you can use **Find Nearby** to get directional guidance. If not, you can still use **Play Sound**, as long as it has enough battery.
    

If Find My shows your lost earbud as **Offline**, you’ll still see its last known location. This can be enough to help you retrace your steps. Once you get within Bluetooth range again, the status may change to **Online** and let you use **Play Sound**.

If you think the earbud is still somewhere in your home, try refreshing Find My while walking slowly from room to room. The device may reconnect once you get close enough.

## How to find a missing AirPods case

Finding the AirPods case is a little trickier because only newer models have support for sound playback or Precision Finding. If your case supports Find My, you’ll see options similar to locating the earbuds themselves. If it doesn’t, the app will only show the last place the case was connected.

If your earbuds are in the case but the case is not supported by Find My, you may not be able to play sound until you open it or pull one of the earbuds out.

Find My is a powerful tool for tracking down misplaced AirPods, and knowing how to use all of its features makes the search much easier. Whether you’re trying to find the entire set, one stray earbud or a case that wandered off, the app can lead you back to them with sound alerts, location markers and even directional guidance on supported models. With a few minutes of searching, you’ll usually have your AirPods back in your ears and your music playing again.
