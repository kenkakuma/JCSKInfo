summary: U.S.-China trade tensions reached a boiling point last week before quickly cooling as both sides signaled a willingness to step back from the brink. President Trump's threat of punitive 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, triggered by Beijing's sweeping export controls on rare earth elements, sparked a global market selloff and fears of a renewed trade war. However, within days, conciliatory rhetoric from Washington and confirmed plans for a Trump-Xi summit in South Korea helped markets rebound amid cautious optimism for de-escalation.

**Rapid Escalation Triggers Market Panic**

The latest flare-up began October 9 when China dramatically expanded its rare earth export controls, requiring foreign companies to obtain Chinese government approval for exporting products containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earth materials or produced using Chinese equipment. The new restrictions, which China defended as "legitimate" national security measures, effectively gave Beijing veto power over global technology supply chains.​

Trump responded swiftly on October 10, threatening to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1. The president also announced new export controls on "critical software" to China and suggested he might cancel his planned meeting with Xi Jinping. The escalation sent U.S. stocks tumbling, with the Dow suffering its worst day since April.​

Adding fuel to the fire, both countries began implementing new port fees on each other's vessels on October 14 , with China sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipping giant Hanwha Ocean. The tit-for-tat measures underscored how the dispute had expanded beyond traditional tariffs to encompass shipping, technology, and critical minerals.​

**Swift De-escalation as Officials Soften Rhetoric**

By October 12-13, both sides began walking back from confrontation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed in a Fox Business interview that the Trump-Xi meeting remained on track for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, stating "we have substantially de-escalated". Crucially, Bessent indicated the threatened 100% tariffs "do not have to be implemented" if negotiations succeed.​

Trump himself adopted a more conciliatory tone, posting on Truth Social that the U.S. "wants to help China, not hurt it" and reassuring that trade relations would "all be fine". China's Commerce Ministry confirmed working-level talks had resumed Monday, though it urged Washington to "show sincerity" rather than mixing dialogue with threats.​

The softer rhetoric sparked an immediate market recovery. U.S. stocks rebounded sharply , with investors taking comfort from signs that both sides were seeking an "off-ramp" from escalation. Commodities like copper jumped 3.56% on Trump's reassuring comments , while rare earth stocks surged as supply concerns eased.​

**Fragile Détente Ahead of Critical Summit**

Despite the immediate de-escalation, analysts warn the underlying tensions remain unresolved. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson cautioned that without progress by early November, markets could face a correction of 10-15%. The dispute highlights how U.S.-China relations have become a "structural feature of the new geoeconomic realities" rather than a cyclical issue.​

The planned Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea later this month now carries enormous weight for global markets and supply chains. While working-level talks continue this week alongside World Bank meetings in Washington , both leaders face domestic pressure to appear tough while avoiding economic damage. Success could restore stability to the world's most important bilateral relationship, while failure risks reigniting the cycle of retaliation that has repeatedly roiled global markets throughout 2025.
