Fitbit is mostly associated with [tracking](https://www.engadget.com/deals/fitbit-black-friday-deals-are-here-early-and-one-of-our-favorite-fitness-trackers-is-on-sale-for-100-185704387.html) your steps, workouts and sleep, but also among its arsenal of overall health features is the ability to [track](https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237210?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-i-log-food-in-the-fitbit-app) your food intake. You can use it to see how many calories you’ve consumed versus how many you’ve burned, and even scan the barcode of pre-made food items to add them to your daily log. But the food log feature in the Fitbit app currently appears to be broken, or at least not working as it’s supposed to.

As spotted by [_9to5Google_](https://9to5google.com/2025/11/07/fitbit-food-log-outage/), various problems have been reported during the last 24 hours, and while the page still loads as it should, adding items is proving difficult. Attempting to search for a meal or food pulls up a blank page, while the barcode scanner seems to be completely broken, returning a maintenance error message when you try to use it.

A number of Fitbit users are [reporting](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/iOS-App/Food-search-stopped-working/td-p/5792950) similar issues, with only the custom food creation function working properly. Some have also [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1oqdxlv/fitbit_app_food_search_is_down/) that they tried updating the app to fix it, but with no success. One user who deleted and re-installed the Fitbit app said that didn’t work either, while another said they “really rely on the calorie count feature,” which obviously won’t be accurate if you can’t log every meal you eat.

Google, Fitbit's parent company, has not officially commented on the matter at the time of writing, and we’ll update this article if it responds to our request for one.
