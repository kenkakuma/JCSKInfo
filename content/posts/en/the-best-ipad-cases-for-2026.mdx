An iPad is a great all-purpose device, but it also needs protection if you want it to last. A good case can guard against drops, add a stand for videos or sketching sessions and even make your iPad feel more like a lightweight laptop. Whether you prefer something slim, rugged or packed with useful features, there is a case that fits the way you use your tablet.  
  
From keyboard folios to minimalist covers with room for your Apple Pencil, we rounded up the best iPad cases that keep your tablet safe without weighing it down.

## Best iPad cases for 2026

## Why do I need an iPad case?

It’s almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it’s protected against hazards and accidents. The [best iPads](https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html) are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible.

## iPad case FAQs

### What is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover?

All iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers — yes, it’s a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.

### How often should I charge my iPad?

How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.
