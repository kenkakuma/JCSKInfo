It's time for more speedrunning (and other shenanigans) with the Games Done Quick (GDQ) crew. The first event of the year, Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), kicks off on Sunday, January 4, with _Super Mario Sunshine_. Donations for this year's shindig will benefit the [Prevent Cancer Foundation](https://preventcancer.org/).

AGDQ 2026 has a whole week of 24/7 speedruns on tap. You'll see slots for some of 2025's biggest games: [_Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_,](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-dropped-a-big-update-after-sweeping-the-game-awards-183628313.html) [_Hollow Knight: Silksong_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksongs-upcoming-dlc-pack-will-be-free-for-all-players-123055729.html) and [_Hades II_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-on-september-25-133511122.html) are part of the festivities. _Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater_ gets both a standard run and a "versus" showdown. There's also plenty of classic Nintendo fare, including (among others) _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_, _Mario Kart World_, _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD_ and _Super Mario 64_.

GDQ

If you like weird, there’s plenty of that to chew on, too. The GDQ team is fond of dusting off forgotten, uh, "gems" for some entertaining playthroughs. Who can forget 1996's _Bill Nye: The Science Guy - Stop the Rock!_ or 1994's _Adventures of Yogi Bear?_ And although it's a 2022 game, children of the '80s can revisit the gross-out trading cards of their youth, in _Garbage Pail Kids: Mad Mike and the Quest for Stale Gum_.

AGDQ 2026 runs from January 4 to 10. The livestream begins on Sunday at 11:30AM ET on [the official GDQ Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick). You can browse the [full schedule](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/62) for more details.
