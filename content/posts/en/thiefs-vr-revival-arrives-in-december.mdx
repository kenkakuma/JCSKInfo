Much like [_Half-Life: Alyx_](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html), Thief's long-awaited return is a VR exclusive. The game was announced in June, but now we [know](https://www.meta.com/blog/thief-vr-quest-gameplay-release-date/) when it will arrive. You can play the pioneering stealth franchise's new chapter, _Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow_, on December 4.

_Thief VR_ takes place about halfway between the events of the original trilogy and [_Thief_ (2014)](https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-24-thief-review-for-the-hoard.html). You play as Magpie, a cunning thief (duh), who discovers a legendary eye artifact with a mysterious connection to the past. You're operating in a city that's under the grip of Baron Ulysses Northcrest, "a tyrant who crushes rebellion before it can take root." That all sounds like an ideal backdrop for sneaking around and stealing shit.

Publisher Vertigo Games offered a glimpse at Meta Quest gameplay, which you can watch below. _Thief VR_ will also be available on PS VR and SteamVR when it arrives on December 4. The title has a $30 list price on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/) and [Meta](https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/), but can be pre-ordered now for $27. The [PlayStation Store](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010853/) version doesn't yet have pricing or reservation info.
