Blizzard [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw) today that it is introducing the Warlock as a playable character to _Diablo II: Resurrected_. It brings the first new class in 25 years to this remaster of the original RPG. It’s part of the _Reign of the Warlock_ DLC, which is available today and will run you $25. It also includes some other updates to the base game, including new items and a new pinnacle boss encounter against the Colossal Ancients. For those players who don’t already own the base game, you can also pick up the Infernal Edition of _D2R_ for $40, which includes the new content.

When _D2R_ [launched](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bethesda-blizzard-diablo-2-resurrected-hd-remaster-175939269.html) in 2021, it was an impressively faithful recreation of the game that so many Blizzard fans continued to adore over the years. Bringing in a whole new player class is a big win for those players who have stuck with the game in its contemporary era.

If _D2R_ isn't your jam, though, Warlock is also being added to both _Diablo 4_ in its upcoming _Lord of Hatred_ expansion this April and to _Diablo Immortal_. So aside from _Diablo 3_ not getting much love, just about all fans of the franchise will have a chance to get into the demon-summoning groove. Blizzard's 30th anniversary showcase [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw) has all the details about what the other Diablo titles have in store during this year.

Blizzard has been keeping the news and updates rolling over the past few weeks in honor of the company's [35th anniversary](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzard-lines-up-wow-overwatch-hearthstone-and-diablo-showcases-154912932.html). One of the more notable updates came for team hero shooter _Overwatch_, which lost the 2 in its name, but gained five more heroes in its big [update](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-will-drop-the-2-as-jetpack-cat-and-four-other-heroes-arrive-on-february-10-184500327.html?guccounter=1) yesterday.
