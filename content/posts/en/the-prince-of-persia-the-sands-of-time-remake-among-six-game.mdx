Two high-profile upcoming Ubisoft games have been starting to look more and more like vaporware with each passing year. One of them is _Beyond Good & Evil 2_, which we were [assured](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/beyond-good--evil-2-is-somehow-still-under-development-185230052.html) is still in development last year. The other is the _Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time_ remake, which is now officially canceled, along with five other games on Ubisoft’s release slate.

The news came in a media briefing attended virtually by [_VGC_](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-details-major-company-reset-6-games-canned-7-delayed-and-2-studios-closed/), in which the French company also announced delays to seven other games as part of a major restructuring. As reported by _VGC_, the only canceled game currently named by Ubisoft is the remake of its 2003 classic, which was first [announced](https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-january-21-194054196.html) in 2020 and has by all accounts been in various [stages](https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-191158018.html) of development [hell](https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-toronto-is-helping-out-with-the-troubled-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-050059045.html) ever since. Three of the others were original new IPs and one was a mobile game.

Ubisoft isn’t putting names to the more than half dozen delayed games either, but _VGC_’s report says one was supposed to come out in the first quarter of this year, and will now release before April 2027. While it’s yet to be officially announced, a remake of _Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag_ has been heavily [rumored](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake) for several months and is likely one of the games that has slipped.

Ubisoft also outlined its new organizational model, which will see the company split into five "creative houses" that function as independent business units. One of these is the previously [announced](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html), Tencent-backed Vantage Studios, which will oversee a number of the company’s flagship franchises, including Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.

In its Wednesday briefing, Ubisoft also confirmed recent reports that it’s closing its [Stockholm](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html) and (recently unionized) [Halifax](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html) studios, with others, including [_Star Wars Outlaws_](https://www.engadget.com/i-really-want-to-like-star-wars-outlaws-160032476.html) developer Massive Entertainment due to be restructured as a result of the new model. Ubisoft declined to tell _VGC_ exactly how many layoffs could occur in the wake of the large-scale reorganization of the company.
