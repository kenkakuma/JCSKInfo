Tesla’s shareholders have voted in favor of a compensation [plan](https://www.votetesla.com/compensation-proposals/) that could see CEO Elon Musk become the world's first trillionaire. The potential incentives were [laid out](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-board-to-elon-musk-hit-these-milestones-and-well-make-you-a-trillionaire-170914461.html) in September, and the company's shareholders have agreed to allow this all-or-nothing package for its chief exec, who spent the first half of this year [decimating the US federal government](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-leaves-doge-amid-tanking-tesla-sales-153859407.html) rather than working on any Tesla-adjacent projects. 

The compensation plan lists several targets that the company must reach for Musk to reap the vast rewards. Tesla must reach a market value of $8.5 trillion, compared with its current worth of about $1.4 billion. Other requirements are metrics-based, such as selling a million robots with humanoid qualities, while others are strategic, such as establishing a succession plan for future Tesla leadership. Musk also has a lot of other irons in the fire across SpaceX and xAI, so the incentives may be an effort to keep the CEO focused on generating more money for this specific group of supporters.

Presently, most times the Tesla name makes headlines, it's not for good press. The company coupled record-high revenue with tumbling profits in its [Q3 2025](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-profits-plunge-despite-record-revenue-and-deliveries-133004231.html) financial results. Just during October, it was the subject of [multiple](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html) [investigations](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/federal-investigators-are-looking-into-teslas-mad-max-mode-which-reportedly-defies-speed-limits-170913959.html) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and incurred the [wrath](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/california-regulators-threaten-to-revoke-teslas-insurance-license-for-mishandling-claims-180942929.html) of the California Department of Insurance.
