[_Stardew Valley_](https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-20-million-copies-sold-184832175.html) is truly the gift that keeps on giving. Fans of the farm life simulator, specifically those who already own it for the Nintendo Switch 2, can download a [free upgrade](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/) that introduces new features and multiplayer modes. However, fans have reported some bugs following the free release, and Eric Barone, the game's developer that's better known as ConcernedApe, is working on fixes.

If you have _Stardew_ _Valley_ on the Switch 2, you can download the Upgrade Pack that introduces mouse controls to make it easier to place furniture and organize your inventory. The upgrade also adds local split-screen co-op for up to four players and online multiplayer that maxes out at eight players. On top of the co-op modes, the free content pack includes Game Share compatibility, meaning only one player needs a copy of _Stardew Valley_ to share it with three others.

This Upgrade Pack may not have as much content as a numbered update, but [some players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huiD0yR4_4I) are already reporting bugs. According to user accounts, the online multiplayer mode isn't working, while other reports noted that some crafting recipes had inaccurate material requirements or quantities. In a [post on X](https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737), Barone said that he's taking "full responsibility for this mistake" and that the development team "will fix this as soon as possible." On top of addressing the bugs from the latest Upgrade Pack, Barone and the rest of the development team are also working on the upcoming [1.7 update](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/stardew-valley-is-getting-yet-another-surprise-update-161805119.html) for _Stardew Valley_, while [_Haunted Chocolatier_](https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-creators-next-game-is-haunted-chocolatier-133102155.html) is still under development.
