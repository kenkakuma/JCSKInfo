The best cheap iPhone

### iPhone 16E

The iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.

#### Score: 7

Pros

Cons

*   Reliable performance
*   Good, if limited, camera system
*   It’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy
*   No MagSafe
*   $599 feels like $100 too much
*   No ultrawide

### Where to Buy:

*   [$599 at **Apple**](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e)
*   [$599.99 at **Best Buy**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-16e-128gb-apple-intelligence-black-verizon/6443386.p)
*   [$599.99 at **Verizon**](https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-16e/)

__**Screen:** 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / **Processor:** A18 **Cameras:** 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / **Charging:** 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / **Weather-resistance rating:** IP6__8

If I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly _cheap._ If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.

There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the newer iPhone Air. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.

Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far [is underwhelming](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai), and the most interesting bits [won’t arrive anytime soon](https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought). If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.

## The best Android phone under $500

### Google Pixel 9A

The Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.

#### Score: 8

Pros

Cons

*   Robust IP68 rating
*   Seven years of software updates
*   Brighter, bigger screen
*   Missing a couple of AI features
*   AI is occasionally handy, usually weird

### Where to Buy:

*   [$499 $449.99 at **Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHV7N4X/)
*   [$499 at **Best Buy**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6612957.p)
*   [$499 at **Google**](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a?hl=en-US)

**Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68**

Google’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right.

The phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.

The 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.

## The budget phone with a big, beautiful screen

### OnePlus 13R

The OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.

#### Score: 6

Pros

Cons

*   Excellent battery life
*   Great screen for the price
*   Six years of security updates
*   No wireless charging
*   Only splash-resistant
*   Fewer OS updates than Google and Samsung

### Where to Buy:

*   [$599.99 $549.99 at **Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP95BLLG/)
*   [$599.99 $549.99 at **Best Buy**](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p?skuId=6609358)
*   [$599.99 $549.99 at **OnePlus**](https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-13r)

__**Screen:** 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / **Processor:** Snapdragon 8 Gen_ 3 _**Cameras:** 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / **Battery:** 6,000mAh / **Charging:** 80W wired / **Weather-resistance rating:** IP6__5

The OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best _big_ screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.

There’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.

## Other budget phones to consider

*   The [**2025 Motorola Moto G Power**](https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Power-Unlocked-Camera/dp/B0DP5FW9QQ/) offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.
*   The [**Samsung Galaxy S24 FE**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLCPN9T/?th=1) is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the [newer Galaxy S25](https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera). [Read our review](https://www.theverge.com/24305866/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review-camera-battery-screen).
*   The [**Samsung Galaxy A56**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FB48RFL5?th=1) recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.
*   We got [our first glimpse](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335983/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-e-ink-specs-ces) of the [**TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F62N5KXF) back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. [Read our initial impressions](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335983/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-e-ink-specs-ces).
*   The [**Samsung Galaxy A36 5G**](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-A36-Smartphone-Connectivity-Performance/dp/B0DXHPNPYX/) is another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.
