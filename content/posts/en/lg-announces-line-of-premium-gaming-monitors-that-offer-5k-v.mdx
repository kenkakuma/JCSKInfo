LG has revealed a new lineup of gaming monitors [just ahead of CES](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000106.html). The UltraGear evo displays offer 5K visuals. Many incorporate on-device AI upscaling, taking some of the burden away from the GPU. 

LG says the tech will let consumers skip out on some card upgrades. This could end up being extremely beneficial because the AI boom has [been impacting GPU prices](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html).

There are three displays in the lineup so far, with more to come down the line. There's a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will "refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience."

This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time. It's curved with a 21:9 aspect ratio.

There's also a 27-inch MiniLED (27GM950B) in the lineup. This display has been "designed to dramatically improve blooming control", which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it "preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike."

This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.

Finally, there's the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display. You didn't read that wrong. This is a 52-inch gaming monitor. This 5K display offers a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.

LG hasn't released any information as to when we'll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost. With all the tech on offer, it's likely they'll cost a pretty penny.
