Canon released its first PowerShot camera [back in 1996](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b8d24f45-f21a-4835-9b86-40a1c64f57a1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d0dd4c81-13c0-41a6-9330-3ee71b10878b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Canon&linkText=back+in+1996&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbC5jYW5vbi9lbi9jLW11c2V1bS9wcm9kdWN0L2RjYzQ1MS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMGRkNGM4MS0xM2MwLTQxYTYtOTMzMC0zZWU3MWIxMDg3OGIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNhbm9uL2VuL2MtbXVzZXVtL3Byb2R1Y3QvZGNjNDUxLmh0bWwifQ&signature=AQAAAdaff4Qbe1iDOHIbTEhGZ3xITIVZTjDusySyxAdpPYUr&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.canon%2Fen%2Fc-museum%2Fproduct%2Fdcc451.html) with a 0.5-megapixel sensor, helping kickstart the digital photo revolution. To celebrate that 30-year anniversary, the company has unveiled a Limited Edition version of its still-popular PowerShot G7 X III compact camera. It has a few unique touches but is otherwise the same as the original model released nearly [seven years ago](https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-g5-x-ii-cameras.html).

The limited edition model has a new “graphite” color with a knurled front ring designed to exude “luxury and quality,” Canon wrote. It also carries 30 year anniversary logo printed on the body “to create a special feeling suitable for limited edition models,” the company added in the most Canon-y way possible.

As a reminder, the G7 X III was one of the first cameras [announced specifically](https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-canon-powershot-g7-x-iii-g5-x-ii-cameras.html) as a model for vloggers, thanks to its ability to shoot vertical video for Instagram. It features a 20.1MP sensor, flip-up 3-inch touchscreen, 24-100mm f/1.8-2.8 zoom lens and a microphone input. It supports 4K 30 fps video with no cropping and can shoot 1080p at 120 fps. The _piece de resistance_ is direct streaming to YouTube directly over Wi-Fi, then a new thing but now a common feature. It originally retailed for $749.

The G7 X III had been in short supply until recently, but used models became popular with influencers [several years ago](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/this-odd-camera-is-trending-and-it-shows-that-camera-brands-dont-understand-what-influencers-want) and started selling way above list price. Possibly because of that viral fame, Canon announced in August 2025 that it was increasing production and the G7 X III started [returning to stock](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/compact-cameras/stop-overpaying-for-the-trendy-canon-powershot-g7x-mark-iii-this-viral-compact-camera-is-finally-showing-signs-of-returning-to-stock-at-list-price) a few months later priced at $880.

The Limited Edition G7 X III is selling for a lot more than that at $1,299, though it does come with a limited edition Peak Design cuff wrist strap and 32GB SD card. If you want to one-up the influencers and grab one, shipping will start in April 2026.

Along with the camera, Canon announced a pair of interesting new RF-mount full-frame lenses. The first is the ultra wide angle RF 14mm f/1.4 L VCM prime model priced at $2,599, promising bright, high quality optics. The other is a very interesting $1,899 RF7-14mm f/2.8-3.5 L Fisheye STM zoom lens with up to a 190 degree perspective at the widest setting.
