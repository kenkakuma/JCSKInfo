YouTube Music has started putting lyrics — a previously free feature [introduced in 2020](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-youtube-music-now-playing-redesign.html) — behind a paywall, according to multiple [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1qyf4qp/youtube_music_now_needs_premium_for_lyrics/) and [_9to5Google_](https://9to5google.com/2026/02/07/youtube-music-lyrics-premium/). In the latest update, the “Lyrics” tab in the Now Playing screen displays a warning message: “You have \[x\] views remaining. Unlock lyrics with Premium.” Free users get lyrics for five songs, then after that, will only see a few lines before the rest of the song is blurred.

Google has been testing the feature since at least September with a limited number of users, according to [previous reports](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-music-test-lyrics-paywall-subscription/). It’s been [speculated](https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-lyrics-paywall-test-3596417/) that YouTube may have made the change to recuperate costs spent with lyric aggregators like Musixmatch. Spotify also put lyrics behind its Premium paywall [in 2024](https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-premium-lyrics-3439096/), but a user backlash forced it to [reinstate the feature](https://www.engadget.com/spotify-lyrics-are-back-for-free-users-175200293.html) for free users.

Google has yet to confirm the change, and while it appears to be a larger rollout, the feature change could still be in testing. YouTube Music’s Premium subscription costs $10.99 in the US with ad-free playback, offline downloads, AI features and more — the same as its main rivals Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music.
