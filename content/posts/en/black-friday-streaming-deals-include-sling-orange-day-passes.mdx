Sling TV is one of the best live streaming streaming services out there right now, giving you the option to watch a number of traditional cable channels without the traditional, locked-in price of a cable subscription. For Black Friday, you can save on Sling TV's newly announced [$5 Day Passes](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html). That $5 price is the regular cost — for a limited time through November 30, a [Day Pass for Sling Orange](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5e010af9-afb1-40de-9edc-5edf9f91cb44&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Sling+TV&linkText=Day+Pass+for+Sling+Orange&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vc2VydmljZS9zbGluZy1vcmFuZ2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVlMDEwYWY5LWFmYjEtNDBkZS05ZWRjLTVlZGY5ZjkxY2I0NCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3NlcnZpY2Uvc2xpbmctb3JhbmdlIn0&signature=AQAAAfymm7opOSv5ChBe7b9WUV17H5YSuh-xmFnlVAGm_812&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fservice%2Fsling-orange) is only $1 and that includes access to 34 channels like ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3.

Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for [the best customizable live streaming service](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html) for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them.

It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games [scheduled for that Thursday](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5e010af9-afb1-40de-9edc-5edf9f91cb44&featureId=text-link&merchantName=USA+TODAY&linkText=scheduled+for+that+Thursday&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL25mbC8yMDI1LzExLzE2L25mbC10aGFua3NnaXZpbmctZ2FtZXMtMjAyNS1zY2hlZHVsZS10ZWFtcy84NzI1OTE1NzAwNy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVlMDEwYWY5LWFmYjEtNDBkZS05ZWRjLTVlZGY5ZjkxY2I0NCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwvMjAyNS8xMS8xNi9uZmwtdGhhbmtzZ2l2aW5nLWdhbWVzLTIwMjUtc2NoZWR1bGUtdGVhbXMvODcyNTkxNTcwMDcvIn0&signature=AQAAAYwRJFF4c7zI58GYYVIviTGick92I4bWibUrM3JduJKF&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fnfl%2F2025%2F11%2F16%2Fnfl-thanksgiving-games-2025-schedule-teams%2F87259157007%2F). To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month.

Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV's interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you're likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.
