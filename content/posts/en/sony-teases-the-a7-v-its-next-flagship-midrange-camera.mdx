Sony appears to be ready to announce another addition to its Alpha camera lineup. The company [shared an image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRhebKMjuSS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) on the Sony Alpha Instagram account with the text "Chase your dream" and the date December 2 at 9AM EST, which could be a teaser for its next mirrorless camera.

It's possible the company has something else in mind, but the giant "V" or Roman numeral five in the background of the image seems like a clear reference to an unannounced Sony A7 V, a follow-up to the Sony Alpha 7 IV. Considering there was around a four year gap between the release of the [A7 III](https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-26-sony-a7-iii-mirrorless-camera.html) and [A7 IV](https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-camera-arrives-with-a-33-megapixel-sensor-and-4k-60p-video-141301936.html), releasing the new camera in 2026 would make the timing lineup, too.

Rumors suggest the A7 V could feature [a new 33MP "partially stacked sensor"](https://www.sonyalpharumors.com/sony-a7v-uses-a-new-33mp-partially-stacked-sensor-and-shoots-30fps-in-electronic-shutter-mode/) designed by Sony, along with the ability to capture 4K / 60 fps video. The company is also rumored to be announcing [at least two new lenses](https://www.sonyalpharumors.com/%f0%9f%94%a5-sony-is-about-to-announce-the-worlds-fastest-f-2-0-ultra-wide-zoom-lens-2-more-telezooms/) to go with the new camera. Since the Alpha 7 IV started at $2,500, it seems safe to expect that these upgrades could cost even more when the camera is officially announced in December.
