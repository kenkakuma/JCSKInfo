After launching it in China earlier, DJI has unveiled its flagship smartphone gimbal, the [Osmo Mobile 8](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=479372ad-6013-4434-bdb7-ebc5486af4cc&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=9b626b32-f56c-4214-b882-8d5f9d130041&featureId=text-link&merchantName=DJI&linkText=Osmo+Mobile+8&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kamkuY29tL29zbW8tbW9iaWxlLTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjliNjI2YjMyLWY1NmMtNDIxNC1iODgyLThkNWY5ZDEzMDA0MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGppLmNvbS9vc21vLW1vYmlsZS04In0&signature=AQAAAQ2codZo2pbWsy5AQ_akQRKSJHJAYbLFARAa0YEx4mwE&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fosmo-mobile-8). The new model looks much like the [Osmo Mobile 7P](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-osmo-mobile-7p-gimbal-can-track-you-around-on-any-android-or-ios-camera-app-130037243.html) and has the same Multifunctional tracking module with a built-in light. However, it adds a bunch of useful new functionality including Apple DockKit support, 360-degree panning and pet tracking. 

The lack of Apple DockKit support was an issue with the Osmo Mobile 7P, as it made tracking yourself trickier with some apps. It also put DJI behind [Insta360's Flow 2 Pro](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360s-flow-pro-2-gimbal-offers-a-sturdier-build-and-a-selfie-mirror-130016865.html), which does support DockKit. That's no longer an issue with the Osmo Mobile 8, though. You can now do subject tracking within the native iPhone camera app or any of the 200-plus iOS applications compatible with DockKit.

At the same time, full tracking is available via the Multifunctional Module. That attaches to the side of its updated, more secure magnetic phone mount, letting you track yourself or other subjects automatically with any camera app. It includes a surprisingly powerful LED fill light and works as a receiver for DJI's wireless microphones, including the Mic Mini, Mic 2 and Mic 3. On top of humans, the module now supports dog and cat tracking as well. As before, it also supports gesture control.

Another key feature is a pan axis that supports 360 degree horizontal rotation that no longer hits a stop as before. That means when you lock onto moving subjects with intelligent tracking, it'll keep following them even if they go all the way around the camera. The updated, more comfortable grip (and 0.8 pound weight) also makes it easier to take low angle shots, something that that will be handy when trying to follow your cat around. 

When using DJI's Mimo app, you also get access to DJI's advanced ActiveTrack 7.0.1 tracking tech. It comes with a feature called Dual Lens Boost 2 that uses your phones wide-angle and telephoto lenses to make sure a subject isn't lost, even if they move quickly or within a crowded scene. Another feature, Smart Capture, makes it easy to switch between subjects, even in complex environments, according to DJI. 

The OM8 uses DJI's latest three-axis stabilization tech to smooth even jarring movements without hurting quality like a smartphone can do. Other features include an integrated tripod, easy switching between front and rear cameras (along with the ability to flip the camera 180 degrees for rear camera selfies), an integrated tripod and a built-in extension rod. DJI's Osmo Mobile 8 gimbal is now available in Europe for 159 euros, with US pricing and availability to be announced shortly.
