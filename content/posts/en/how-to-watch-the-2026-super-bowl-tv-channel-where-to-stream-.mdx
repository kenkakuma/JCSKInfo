We might still be in the midst of the playoffs, but that doesn't mean we can't plan ahead for [Super Bowl LX](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/topic/super-bowl/). For those of you who just can't with Roman numerals, thats Super Bowl 60, and it's taking place this year at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA, on February 8, starting at 6:30 p.m. ET. 

Like all other Sunday Night Football games this season, the championship game will be broadcast on Super Bowl Sunday on NBC, and will stream live on Peacock. And it's not just the game that we're excited for, either. This year's halftime performer is singer and rapper Bad Bunny, and there will be pre-game performances by Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile, and Coco Jones, it's truly an incredible lineup of talent. So while we wait to find out which teams will be competing in this year's game, the least we can do is let you know everything you need to know to tune in to Super Bowl LX when it airs on Feb. 8.
