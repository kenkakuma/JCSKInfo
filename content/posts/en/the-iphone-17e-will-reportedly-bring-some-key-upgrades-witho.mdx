Apple is keeping the entry level for iPhones at $599, according to _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman. In the latest [Power On report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-), Gurman said that the iPhone 17e is "due imminently" and will keep the same price as its predecessor.

Considering we’re about a year away from the [iPhone 16e](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html)’s announcement, we’re due for a successor to Apple’s more affordable smartphone. According to Gurman, Apple upgraded the new budget-friendly iPhone with MagSafe charging and the A19 chip that's seen in the [iPhone 17 base model](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-review-closer-to-pro-110055511.html). The iPhone 17e will also get Apple's latest in-house cellular and wireless chips, Gurman reported. 

In our review of the [iPhone 16e](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html), we weren't particularly sold because of its limited camera capabilities, particularly when compared to the [iPhone 17](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-makes-the-iphone-16e-even-more-pointless-123000387.html)'s release a few months later. However, for the same $599 price, Apple's iPhone 17e is getting a few notable upgrades and will compete with Google's [Pixel 10a](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/you-can-pre-order-the-pixel-10a-on-february-18-180712018.html). More specifically, Gurman expects Apple to target the emerging economies and enterprise demographics with the iPhone 17e. While Apple faces a lot more competition in overseas markets, iPhone sales have been experiencing a resurgence in [China](https://www.wired.com/story/how-iphones-made-a-surprising-comeback-in-china/). Apple is even forecasting [strong sales](https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-sales-profit-beat-wall-street-estimates-amid-staggering-iphone-demand-2026-01-29/) for iPhones across Asia, especially in China and India.
