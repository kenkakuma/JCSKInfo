A new and improved Siri may finally make an appearance, but this time, it could be with a Google Gemini glow up. According to [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-25/inside-apple-s-ai-shake-up-ai-safari-and-plans-for-new-siri-in-ios-26-4-ios-27-mktqy7xb)'s Mark Gurman, Apple wants to announce a new Siri in "the second half of February" that will show off the results of its recently announced [partnership with Google](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html) and offer demonstrations of the Gemini-powered capabilities.

After this reveal, Gurman reported that the new Siri will make its way to iOS 26.4, which is also slated to enter beta testing in February before its public release in March or early April. Apple has been meaning to launch its [next-gen Siri](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html) ever since its announcement at WWDC 2024, but now we know that this Gemini-powered Siri will behave more like an [AI chatbot](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-overhauling-siri-to-be-an-ai-chatbot-205303818.html), similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, thanks to another [_Bloomberg_ report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2OTAyNDk2NywiZXhwIjoxNzY5NjI5NzY3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFRXOVlLR0NURlUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJDNEVEQ0FFMUZBMDU0MEJFQTI0QTlGMjExQzFFOTA4MCJ9.awOoIDGdEkCAvho8waoXR6VVVojI3jGvQHJeDjwcyrs&leadSource=uverify%20wall) from last week. 

Following the reported demo that's scheduled for late February, Gurman said Apple will have a grand reveal of the new Siri, which is currently codenamed Campos, at its annual developer conference in the summer. After that, the latest Siri and the accompanying Gemini-powered Apple Intelligence features are expected to arrive with iOS 27, iPadOS 27 and macOS 27, which are expected to be available as beta releases in the summer.
