Valve is bringing a helpful update to the Steam Deck, adding an option for downloading content while the screen is off. The company is [calling](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984) it a display-off low-power mode. It will be enabled by default when the Steam Deck is plugged in. The handheld's power settings can also allow it to be active while on battery power, although it will automatically revert to full sleep mode if the battery drops below 20 percent. If a user hits the power button while the Steam Deck is downloading content, a dialogue prompt will appear asking if the download should continue with the display off. A Steam Deck that reaches an idle timeout will also automatically go into the display-off low-power mode. 

In practice, this is similar to the rest mode modern consoles have that allows for downloads while the machine isn't being actively used. This feature can be really useful if you're playing an online competitive game and don't want a big download infringing on your bandwidth. (I speak from experience here.) Nice for the Steam Deck to offer a similar convenience to its players.
