Behold Mark Zuckerberg: man of principle. Witness the Meta CEO's dedication to the most high-minded of causes: "currying favor with whoever's in charge." In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Zuckerberg co-founded [](http://FWD.us)FWD.us, a pro-immigration advocacy group. For years, he vocally supported providing paths to citizenship for "the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born." Now, in 2025, with Donald Trump back in power and pushing draconian immigration policies, Zuckerberg's philanthropy organization has officially cut ties with the group. Who says Big Tech executives don't stand for anything?

On Friday, _Bloomberg_ [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-19/mark-zuckerberg-s-philanthropy-cut-ties-with-pro-immigration-organization-fwd-us) on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) severing its ties with FWD.us. Zuckerberg's group provided no funding to the advocacy group for the first time this year. Up to that point, over half of the roughly $400 million donated to the nonprofit since 2013 had come from CZI.

In addition, CZI's chief of staff, Jordan Fox, resigned from the FWD.us board. No one else at CZI will fill the vacant slot, another first for the pro-immigration and justice reform advocacy group.

In a statement to Engadget, a spokesperson for CZI said the change had been in the works for several years. “Nearly five years ago, we shared that we were focusing on our core work in science, education, and supporting our local communities,” the spokesperson said. “As part of that transition, we committed foundational funding to [](http://FWD.us)FWD.us to continue their bipartisan work. We have fulfilled that financial commitment and wound down our social advocacy funding.” She added that the couple’s Biohub initiative is currently their “primary philanthropy.”

In late 2024, Zuckerberg met with Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who [reacts](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/president-el-salvador-wont-return-deported-man-kilmar-abrego-garcia-rcna201136) to brown-skinned humans being [sent to foreign gulags](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/08/g-s1-76491/migrants-salvadoran-prison-under-u-s-control) the way my dog responds to a juicy steak. Among other topics during the exchange, Miller reportedly questioned Zuckerberg's ties to [](http://FWD.us)FWD.us.

Apparently, his words resonated with Zuckerberg’s principles. In January, before Trump was sworn in for his second term, [Meta unleashed an overhaul](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/metas-right-wing-reinvention-also-includes-an-end-to-dei-programs-and-trans-messenger-themes-204031848.html) that reads like a Miller wishlist. The company ended its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. That same month, it [ditched third-party fact-checkers](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-ditching-third-party-fact-checkers-on-facebook-instagram-142330246.html), calling them "too politically biased." It also changed its policies to allow for "insulting language" on topics of immigration and LGBTQ+ issues. The company even [added Trump backer Dana White](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-adds-ufc-ceo-and-trump-booster-dana-white-to-its-board-230611306.html) to its board.

It fits a broader pattern of [Big Tech bending the knee to Trump](https://www.engadget.com/general/big-tech-bent-the-knee-for-trump-in-2025-140000365.html).

"We're in the middle of a pretty rapidly changing policy and regulatory landscape that views any policy that might advantage any one group of people over another as something that is unlawful," Zuckerberg [told](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b6527912-d56a-43d8-ab07-30a9ebbe2f23&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+New+York+Times&linkText=told&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzAxLzMwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWFyay16dWNrZXJiZXJnLW1ldGEtdHJ1bXAuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjY1Mjc5MTItZDU2YS00M2Q4LWFiMDctMzBhOWViYmUyZjIzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzAxLzMwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWFyay16dWNrZXJiZXJnLW1ldGEtdHJ1bXAuaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAATuSacrrBu-BdL00nTU42xQp-tqna6Y_65tzWQOpaUHz&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F01%2F30%2Ftechnology%2Fmark-zuckerberg-meta-trump.html) the _New York Times_ in January. "Because of that, we and every other institution out there are going to need to adjust."

"We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning and that will defend our values and interests abroad," Zuckerberg [said](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b6527912-d56a-43d8-ab07-30a9ebbe2f23&featureId=text-link&merchantName=CNBC&linkText=said&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzAxLzI5L21hcmstenVja2VyYmVyZy1zdGFydHMtbWV0YS1lYXJuaW5ncy1jYWxsLWJ5LXByYWlzaW5nLXRydW1wLS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNjUyNzkxMi1kNTZhLTQzZDgtYWIwNy0zMGE5ZWJiZTJmMjMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjUvMDEvMjkvbWFyay16dWNrZXJiZXJnLXN0YXJ0cy1tZXRhLWVhcm5pbmdzLWNhbGwtYnktcHJhaXNpbmctdHJ1bXAtLmh0bWwifQ&signature=AQAAAXHE21TDAie-uAuNZD2X-Q4XALJ5rWkxAZE8CVj2w3Eh&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F01%2F29%2Fmark-zuckerberg-starts-meta-earnings-call-by-praising-trump-.html) in a January investor call. "I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock, so this is going to be a big year."

What a [big year](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/09/nx-s1-5599987/evidence-shows-dhs-claims-about-deportations-since-january-are-not-accurate) indeed.

Now witness the contrasting words of one of Zuckerberg's chief rivals in Silicon Valley. "When you meet these \[immigrant\] children who are really talented, and they've grown up in America, and they really don't know any other country besides that, but they don't have the opportunities that we all enjoy, it's really heartbreaking, right?" the tech executive said. "That seems like it's one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time."

That "rival," of course, was Obama-era [Mark Zuckerberg in 2013](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/11/mark-zuckerberg-immigration-reform-one-of-the-biggest-civil-rights-issues-of-our-time).

Despite the funding setback, thanks to our principled hero, FWD.us will press forward. "We're thankful to our donors, past and present, and so grateful to the many new donors who have stepped up in the past few years — and particularly the influx of new supporters we have seen this year," FWD.us President Todd Schulte said in a statement. "This allows us to fight for immigrants under attack today and to build a better approach to immigration and criminal justice reform for many, many years to come."

**Update, December 19, 2025, 1:19PM PT**: This story was updated to include a statement from a spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
