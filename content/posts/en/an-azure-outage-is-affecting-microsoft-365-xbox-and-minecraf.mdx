Microsoft’s Azure cloud service is experiencing an outage that appears to have hit [Microsoft 365](https://downdetector.com/status/microsoft-365/) , [Xbox](https://downdetector.com/status/xbox-live/) and [Minecraft](https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/). All three show spikes in outage reports on DownDetector around 12PM ET, and the [Azure status page](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status) indicates Microsoft is dealing with issues with “Azure Portal access.”

In the most recent Azure status update as of writing, Microsoft says that “starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services. In addition, customers may experience issues accessing the Azure Portal.”

> We're rerouting affected traffic to alternate healthy infrastructure as a near-term resolution while our investigation into the source of the issue is ongoing.

On the Microsoft 365 Status account on X, Microsoft shared that it is “rerouting affected traffic” to “healthy infrastructure” while it works to address the issue. Users on Reddit have also reported issues [loading Game Pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1oj8lav/comment/nm1ahk1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on Xbox consoles and [accessing some Microsoft 365 enterprise apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1oj9aq1/comment/nm1dlxe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Beyond impacting the Microsoft services that rely on Azure, it’s also appeared to affect the support pages used to communicate issues. Microsoft’s [Xbox Support site](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) currently won’t load at all.  
  
Engadget has contacted Microsoft for more information about the Azure outage. We’ll update this article if we hear back.

At least so far, these Azure issues pale in comparison to [Amazon Web Services outage](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-aws-outage-has-knocked-services-like-alexa-snapchat-fortnite-venmo-and-more-offline-142935812.html) that occurred last week. Amazon’s outage kept popular apps and services offline for hours.
