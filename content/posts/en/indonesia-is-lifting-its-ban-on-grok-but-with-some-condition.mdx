Grok is once again available in Indonesia, after the country lifted its ban on the AI chatbot that was seen generating millions of [sexualized deepfakes](https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html), thousands of which included children. The country's Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs released [a statement](https://www.komdigi.go.id/berita/siaran-pers/detail/kemkomdigi-awasi-ketat-normalisasi-grok-usai-x-sampaikan-komitmen-kepatuhan) earlier today, which said X is allowed to resume service in Indonesia but will be subject to monitoring for any future violations.

According to the Indonesian government agency, X provided a letter that detailed several implemented measures that prevent the misuse of its Grok chatbot. Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space supervision, said in the statement that the agency will test the new measures on an ongoing basis and will ban Grok again if it's found spreading illegal content or violating the country's laws regarding children.

The issue dates back to earlier this year, when Indonesia, along with Malaysia and the Philippines, [banned the AI chatbot](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7y10xm4x2o) after it was found producing sexually explicit deepfake images of women and children without their consent in response to user requests. Later that month, the Philippines lifted its ban on Grok, followed by [Malaysia](https://www.engadget.com/ai/malaysia-lifts-ban-on-grok-after-taking-x-at-its-word-144457468.html) doing the same just a couple of days after. Similar to Indonesia, Malaysian authorities said they will continue to monitor Grok and threatened more enforcement actions if the AI chatbot repeats its past offenses. Beyond the bans, Grok is also facing investigations from California's [attorney general](https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html) and the UK's [media regulator](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html) concerning the same issue.
