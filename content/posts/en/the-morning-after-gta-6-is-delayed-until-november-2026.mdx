Rockstar Games has announced _Grand Theft Auto VI_ 's launch is being [delayed](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html) once again to November 19, 2026. That’s roughly a year from now. It was previously delayed from its 2025 launch window to May 26, 2026. And now again.

If you have the feeling it’s been a while since the last GTA game, you’d be right. _GTA V_ was originally released in 2013 and has been re-released multiple times since then. In fact, it’s a rare game that’s spanned PS3, PS4 and PS5.

Rockstar is likely self-assured that the game will do fine. _Grand Theft Auto Online_, a multiplayer mode for _GTA V_ that can also be downloaded as a standalone game, remains a hit.

“We continue to supply content to _GTA Online_, and in fact we’ve had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it’s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And _GTA V_ has sold more than 220 million units,” said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview with _The Game Business._

### The budget-friendly system is in early production.

Apple may debut a low-cost Mac laptop in the first half of 2026. According to a _Bloomberg_ report, it’s in early production, and Apple is testing the devices internally. The idea may be to create a rival to cheap Chromebooks and Windows PCs, nudging folks into that money-spinning ecosystem. The company is said to be making the system with casual users, students and businesses in mind. (I’d guess many of those users are paying more for MacBooks with power they’ll never really tap into.)

The report suggests it’ll have a “lower-end LCD display,” and it’s expected to run on an A-series iPhone processor that would still, apparently, deliver better performance than the M1.

## [Why DJI drones might be banned in the US](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/us-government-is-getting-closer-to-banning-tp-link-routers-145528317.html)

### Everything you need to know about the Chinese company’s future in America.

DJI drones still face a potential US ban, due to national security concerns. It’s a combination of the company’s Chinese origins and laws compelling cooperation with state intelligence services. It’s also a very visible, notable drone maker — and flying robots understandably make folks nervous. After losing a recent lawsuit and an appeal, DJI is nearing a key December 23, 2025, deadline under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which could trigger an automatic ban. A recent FCC vote and pending legislation could _also_ block sales and even theoretically prevent people from using already-purchased drones by cutting off radio access.

DJI might have to hope a ban will create enough customer outcry to stimulate a political response in its favor.

Honda revealed its new hybrid car tech, and it’s lighter, faster and… actually fun. That’s accomplished by massive weight savings and a surprising S+ Shift mode, which simulates an eight-speed transmission for manual driving fans. We got a first look at the platform that will transform the next-gen Civic and Prelude, officially, hopefully marking the end of the slow, droning hybrid car.
