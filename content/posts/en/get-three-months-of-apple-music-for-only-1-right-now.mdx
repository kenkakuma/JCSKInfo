Looking to switch music streaming platforms [for no real reason](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave)? Apple Music is holding one heck of a sale right now. You can get [three months of use for just $1](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b2a3988-c5c9-4640-8e2b-1de7b2717343&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d6589e2b-6441-40b7-bcca-012765c431fe&featureId=text-link&merchantName=iTunes&linkText=three+months+of+use+for+just+%241&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL211c2ljLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9ob21lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNjU4OWUyYi02NDQxLTQwYjctYmNjYS0wMTI3NjVjNDMxZmUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbXVzaWMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2hvbWUifQ&signature=AQAAAVWKaR-g8gw8ZLddD44bZAjiW1Z9Su86eeai85grr37Y&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fhome). There are some caveats, as this is only for new users on the individual plan. Students and family plans don't count for this.

Also, this has to be redeemed on iPhone, iPad or Mac. When you click the link it'll open up the Apple Music app, so click it from an Apple product to get the deal. Finally, it auto-renews after 90 days at $11 per month. Make sure to cancel ahead of time if you aren't enjoying the service.

As for Apple Music, it's one of the [best music streaming platforms](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html) out there and certainly a perfect choice for those already tied to the Apple ecosystem. It lets you import your own files, which is great for anyone still hanging on to an iTunes library. Otherwise, it offers streaming access to millions upon millions songs like all the rest. It does, however, include some live radio stations staffed by actual people, which is cool.

The app works with Android devices, but it's really designed for Apple products. We also found the spatial audio to sound unnatural at times, but that's partly a limitation of the tech.
