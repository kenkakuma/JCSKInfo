This is a discount of $12 and represents a record low price. If you've been waiting to stock up on some smart plugs, now might be the time.

To that end, this product made our list of the [best smart plugs](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-plug-131542429.html). It's the perfect accessory for those who rely on Alexa to control aspects of the smart home. These plugs are really easy to set up via the Alexa app. You don't have to pop in a Wi-Fi password or anything. It's basically plug-and-play.

Once connected, you'll be able to use any device with Alexa to control whatever it's plugged into. For instance, you can group multiple plugs together as lights and then just say "Alexa, turn all the lights off" and it'll do just that. They are compatible with just about any household device with a physical on/off switch, including lamps and coffee makers.

While these are the perfect smart plugs for Alexa households, they are only for Alexa households. The plugs don't integrate with any other digital assistant. They are still the best choice for those tied into the ecosystem.
