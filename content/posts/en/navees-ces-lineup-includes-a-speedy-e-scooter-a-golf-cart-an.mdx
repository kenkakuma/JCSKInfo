The Chinese micromobility company Navee has some wild new stuff at CES 2026. The lineup is headlined by the UT5 Ultra X, a dual-motor e-scooter with an advertised top speed of 43 mph. And who among us isn't in the market for an auto-following golf cart and a seaplane?

The flagship UT5 Ultra X is a sleek-looking e-scooter with a pair of 2,400W motors. Navee says it can reach a top speed of 43 mph and has a max range of 87 miles. (However, in the world of e-scooters, it's safe to expect the real-world range to be around half of what manufacturers promise.) It has a front and rear hydraulic suspension and front and rear hydraulic disc brakes. Navee claims it can accelerate from 0 to 12 mph in 1.98 seconds.

If you want something that can hold its own on rougher terrain, there's the NT5 Ultra X. A pair of 1,200W motors helps this e-scooter reach a top speed of 40 mph and an advertised range of 56 miles. It has dual-disc brakes and an electronic anti-lock braking system. To help manage the bumps, it has two suspension types: a front telescopic suspension and a rear spring one. Navee claims its steel frame supports up to 330 lbs.

Then there's the Eagle F1X, which could put golf caddies out of work. This electronic cart can carry your clubs (up to 44 lbs). It has a "smart auto-follow" feature that uses a combination of AI and ultra-wideband. It also responds to voice and gesture controls. The 33-lb. cart uses a pair of 250W motors, and Navee claims it can handle 36-hole games. Strangely, the bottom portion looks like an F1 racer because, hey, why not?

To further prove that Navee isn't afraid to jump the shark, the company has a product that could, well, jump over sharks. The WaveFly 5X is an electric seaplane that can "glide on the water and ride into the sky." The company claims a max speed of 53 mph, a cruising speed of 40 mph, and a maximum flight time of 70 minutes. I'm not ready to put my life in its hands, but surely some deep-pocketed adventurer will.

In addition to real-world ranges almost always being much lower than advertised, there are other caveats. First, post-purchase customer support in the world of micromobility is almost always a sketchy prospect. I once had to file a Better Business Bureau claim to get support from even the most well-established brand, Segway. Don't be shocked to experience the same or worse from lesser-known companies.

Second, Navee hasn't yet listed pricing or release dates for its new models. Based on their specs and the company's older gear, you'll likely see prices of well above $1,000 for each one. (And that’s not even counting the seaplane.) Regardless, you can learn more at [the company’s website](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=edf4be96-670d-44a8-9d4d-180b61e32664&featureId=text-link&linkText=the+company%E2%80%99s+website&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25hdmVldGVjaC51cy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVkZjRiZTk2LTY3MGQtNDRhOC05ZDRkLTE4MGI2MWUzMjY2NCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9uYXZlZXRlY2gudXMvIn0&signature=AQAAAV89Ul5wbNxML6OfYrX3pjIot_MOXIzP7Y6Q4QjB6sOh&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnaveetech.us%2F).
