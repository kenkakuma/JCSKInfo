Patreon has spent the last few years pitching itself as a healthier [alternative](https://www.engadget.com/patreon-is-giving-creators-more-tools-to-attract-free-subscribers-130049968.html) to algorithmic social platforms for creators. Now, the membership service is adding a bunch of new social features for its creators in an attempt to make its platform more of a viable alternative to mainstream social media.

The updates include a new post format, [called Quips](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/39299791825293-Sharing-Quips-early-access), that allows creators to share non-paywalled updates that can include text, photos or video. Patreon users can browse quips from creators via the app's redesigned "home" feed, which now includes recommended posts. (Patreon says users can opt to only see posts from creators they're already following if they wish.) The company is also working on a saved posts feature and a tagging feature so creators can @-mention each other in their posts. 

All that may sound a lot like social media, but Patreon CEO Jack Conte says the updates are meant to give creators a way to grow their audience without relying on platforms that aren't as invested in their success. "I don't think of it as competing with Instagram …  I feel like we're competing with what Instagram should have and could have become, but did not," he said in an update shared on his Patreon.

With the updates, the company is also walking a fine line between offering creators an alternative to social media and becoming the type of algorithmic platform it has railed against. Conte seems aware of this tension, noting that the membership-only tab will still deliver updates only from creators people are already following. "If we pivot too much to discovery and you don't see the creators that you're subscribed to and love, then we're not doing our job of helping you cultivate long-term relationships, and we have to fix that," he said.

At the same time, he says there are early signs that the changes will be positive for creators. According to Conte, creators who have tried a beta version of Quips have already seen a significant rise in new free memberships from the feature. So far, there's been a much smaller rise in paid subscribers, with "somewhere in the 5 to 10 percent" range of new paid memberships coming from Quips, though Conte says he's "optimistic" about its potential to drive paid growth,

Patreon plans to roll out these updates slowly, with full availability coming sometime next year. In the meantime, creators who want access to Quips sooner can join a waitlist to be added to the beta.
