IKEA has officially announced its range of Matter-compatible smart home products. The Swedish furniture store is releasing 21 new items under the tentpoles of lighting, sensors and control. [IKEA teased these releases](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikea-goes-all-in-on-matter-with-new-smart-home-products-144232740.html) back in July. 

Part of the roll out will include updates to existing categories in order to work with [Matter](https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html), an open source smart home standard. "We're upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges," Stjepan Begic, product developer at IKEA. "Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home."

As for the products themselves, 11 come as part of the KAJPLATS smart bulb range. They will have a mix of shapes and sizes, along with dimming functionality. Then there's the five smart sensors., starting with an indoor and outdoor motion sensor called MYGGSPRAY, which automatically turns on lights. Similarly, there's MYGGBETT, which sends a notification when a door or window gets opened or closed. 

On the more technical safety side are sensors like TIMMERFLOTTE, which monitors temerature and humidity. Then there's ALPSTUGA, an air quality sensor and KLIPPBOK, a water leakage sensor. 

Finishing the lineup is a range of remote controls and one smart plug, GRILLPLATS, which works with regular lamps and appliances to turn them on and off, along with tracking energy use. Then there's the four BILRESA products, starting with a dual button remote control that can turn lights on and off, adjust the brightness, and create a preset scene. Meanwhile, the remote control with a scroll wheel does similar functions, along with dimming. Two kits of three controls each are available for each type. 

[IKEA](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-and-ikea-end-their-partnership-130052348.html) doesn't include exact pricing or release dates, noting that it might vary market to market. In its July teaser, the company said these products would be available come January next year.
