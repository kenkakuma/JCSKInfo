With the discount applied, you’ll spend $10 per month when billed annually for the Premium tier, with lower-cost Standard and Plus options available depending on how many devices you want to use at once and whether you need offline viewing.

There are more than 200 classes on [MasterClass](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ece2db60-ed2b-4433-8be0-79f90b069400&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=9c284a7e-f983-403b-b08f-04f40f53adb8&featureId=text-link&merchantName=MasterClass&linkText=MasterClass&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXN0ZXJjbGFzcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YzI4NGE3ZS1mOTgzLTQwM2ItYjA4Zi0wNGY0MGY1M2FkYjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3RlcmNsYXNzLmNvbS8ifQ&signature=AQAAARS2zW-FXmWSWYle9PZmgVVuCBsj2SriQ8QqP47m2zpf&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterclass.com%2F) now, and many are led by big names at the top of their fields. Depending on your interests, you might pick up cooking tips from Gordon Ramsay, learn storytelling from Margaret Atwood, explore business strategy with Richard Branson or get insights into performance and mindset from athletes and entertainers. The catalog spans everything from film and TV to wellness, music, science, leadership and photography, so it’s easy to dip in and find something that holds your attention.

Over the years, MasterClass has expanded into a broad learning platform that feels like part streaming service and part educational library. The catalog spans categories like food, film, music, wellness, sports and entrepreneurship, with lessons designed to be short and easy to follow. Since every plan includes access to the full course library, the choice mostly comes down to convenience. The Standard tier supports one device and doesn’t include offline mode, the Plus plan allows streaming on two devices with downloads, and the Premium tier increases that to six devices with offline access as well.

Classes are structured to be approachable whether you want to learn a new skill or just explore a topic out of curiosity. Lessons are broken into bite-sized segments, so it’s easy to watch one or two at a time on a commute or in the evening. Members also get access to a global community, occasional newsletters and the ability to switch between video and audio listening on supported classes.

If you’ve been considering trying MasterClass, this deal makes it a more affordable way to see if it works for you. A subscription can also double as a thoughtful gift, which is one reason it has appeared in Engadget’s roundup of the [best subscription gifts](https://www.engadget.com/the-best-subscription-gifts-to-send-to-your-loved-ones-this-christmas-disney-bundle-masterclass-field-notes-and-more-141830326.html) to send to loved ones. With the current 50 percent discount applied across all tiers, it’s a relatively low-cost way to get access to a large library of professionally produced courses that you can watch at your own pace throughout the year.
