Meta is pausing release of its [Ray-Ban Display smart glasses](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html) to the UK, France, Italy and Canada due to "unprecedented demand and limited inventory," the company said on Monday at CES 2026. There's no new date for the expansion that was originally set for early 2026. "We'll continue to focus on fulfilling orders in the US while we re-evaluate our approach to international availability," Meta wrote on its blog.

Since Meta's display glasses first went on sale, acquiring them has been a challenge. They're not available online and can only be found in a limited number of retail outlets including select Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters and Best Buy locations in the United States. To buy them, you need to book an appointment for a demo at one those stores via Meta's website. Ahead of launch, Meta said it saw "strong" demand for demos with locations booked ahead for several weeks. 

There was optimism that availability would increase as the company expected buying options to "expand" the longer they were on sale. However, with the delay of the planned international launch, it appears that the company still has a mismatch between supply and demand. 

Meta's $799 Ray-Ban Display glasses are its first to incorporate a heads-up display and are also equipped with a camera, stereo speakers, six microphones, WiFi 6 and a finger tracking Neural Band controller. In her review, Engadget's senior reporter Karissa Bell noted that the Ray-Ban display "enables wearers to do much more than what's currently possible with \[other\] Ray-Ban or Oakley models" — provided you don't mind the look of the chunky, chunky frames.
