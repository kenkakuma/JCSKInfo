Even though Nintendo made some serious upgrades with the [Joy-Con 2](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-best-feature-is-its-satisfying-joy-con-2-thunk-150031872.html), you still might end up ditching them for CRKD's Nitro Deck 2. After winning over Nintendo Switch owners with its first [Nitro Deck](https://www.engadget.com/crkd-nitro-deck-review-the-switch-has-never-felt-this-good-130041763.html), CRKD followed it up with an improved design that works for both the original Switch and the [Switch 2](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-arrives-on-june-5-at-450-140642208.html).

To refine the original design, CRKD added several upgrades to the Nitro Deck 2 based on community feedback. The new-and-improved accessory features the company's CaptiStick Technology, which prevents stick drift and isn't affected by magnetic interference like other [Hall effect joysticks](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/crkds-nitro-deck-plus-review-140047889.html). CRKD also offset the right thumbstick and contoured the outer shell for a more ergonomic feel. The Nitro Deck 2 is keeping the swappable stick top feature, but CRKD added the ability to swap out the D-Pad for even more customizability. At the back of the Nitro Deck 2, CRKD managed to squeeze in extra L2 and R2 shoulder buttons alongside the programmable back buttons, which were first seen with the predecessor.

Even if you don't own a Switch 2 yet, the Nitro Deck 2 features a new retractable locking mechanism that can be adjusted to fit both the original Switch and Switch OLED. The Nitro Deck 2 supports a low-latency wired mode thanks to an included adapter, but you can also connect the devices through Bluetooth. Thanks to its wireless connection, the Nitro Deck 2 even works as a controller with PC, mobile or smart TVs.

The Nitro Deck 2 will release in white and smoke black, starting at $99.99. That's a $30 increase from the original Nitro Deck's price tag when it debuted in 2023. CRKD will also offer a carrying case for $39.99 and additional D-Pad and Stick Top packs for $19.99. Nitro Deck 2 is currently available for preorders on [CRKD's website](https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2) and is expected to start shipping in spring 2026.
