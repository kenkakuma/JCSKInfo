Kathleen Kennedy is [stepping down](https://www.starwars.com/news/lucasfilm-leadership) as president of Lucasfilm. Although she will continue as a producer for several Star Wars projects, including upcoming movie [_The Mandalorian and Grogu_](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/disneys-mandalorian-and-grogu-trailer-shows-the-fall-of-a-lumbering-giant-141515618.html), the company will now be helmed by a duo in Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan. It's a big changing of the guard for Star Wars fans, and marks the start of a fresh chapter for the sci-fi universe. 

Before taking over at Lucasfilm, Kennedy had seen great success as a producer with a couple little films you may have heard of: _E.T._ and _Jurassic Park_. She became Lucasfilm's president in 2012 when the company was acquired by Disney. At that point, it had been several years since the last Star Wars movie; _Revenge of the Sith_ closed out the generally panned prequel trilogy in 2005. Fans' best option for Star Wars content was _The Clone Wars_, a standalone film and animated series which were well-regarded but primarily popular among the hardcore devotees rather than reaching the widespread cultural relevance of the prior feature films. 

During Kennedy's tenure, Star Wars returned to the big screen with _The Force Awakens_ in 2015. Although that J.J. Abrams-led trilogy was also a roller coaster for many fans, it marked a renaissance for the franchise. Lucasfilm embarked on two standalone movies in _Rogue One_ and _Solo_, which generated yet more buzz and more money for the company. Star Wars got the full cinematic universe treatment, with critically acclaimed live-action television projects and several new video games. The world fell in love with Baby Yoda. Ewan McGregor finally got to don his Obi-Wan Kenobi robe in a better vehicle. The franchise was back in the mainstream, with the budgets and expectations of media behemoth Disney at its back. No matter your feelings on the current state of Star Wars, it's an impressive accomplishment by Kennedy and a big legacy that she leaves behind at Lucasfilm.

So now that Lucasfilm has arguably ended this phase on a high note, what's next? Dave Filoni moving into the top spot isn't much of a surprise. He's long been seen by fans and seemingly by the company as George Lucas' spiritual successor. Filoni was also the showrunner on _The Clone Wars_ back in the day and has been involved in some capacity with many of the recent TV series, most notably _The Mandalorian_ and _Ahsoka_. All that history means his new role of President and Chief Creative Officer is pretty expected, and the Star Wars faithful likely feel that they are in good hands. 

As the title implies, Filoni will be responsible for the artistic side of the operation, while as Co-President, Lynwen Brennan will be in charge of the business side. Brennan may be a less familiar name, but her tenure with Lucas' businesses dates back to 1999 when she joined the legendary effects studio Industrial Light & Magic. Dividing the art and the commerce can yield good results if the two are able to find a good synergy. Star Wars has proven that it's a moneymaker even when the films and series aren't particularly well-received, but here's hoping that Filoni and Brennan will each be able to maintain high standards for Lucasfilm and the Star Wars fandom.
