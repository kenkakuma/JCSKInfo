Apple only released its [newest iPad](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-latest-ipad-pro-get-a-power-boost-with-the-new-m5-chip-131036435.html) in mid-October but the device is already on sale. Right now you can pick up the [11-inch iPad Pro (M5)](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0FWCXJVHN&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=36d45fcb-10ed-46ff-9b32-53709bae593a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=11-inch+iPad+Pro+%28M5%29&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRldDWEpWSE4_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzZkNDVmY2ItMTBlZC00NmZmLTliMzItNTM3MDliYWU1OTNhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRldDWEpWSE4iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAATwDI1aXS89fzJDPoydoy7fmXypFm0FSNdVIjrvmj0TW&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FWCXJVHN) for $949, down from $999. The five percent discount is exclusive to the 256GB Wi-Fi model with standard glass. It's also only available for the Space Black model, though the Silver version is currently listed as $983. 

We gave the new iPad Pro an [85 in our review](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html), in large part because of its impressive M5 chip. It's especially powerful when you're using the iPad for GPU-powered tasks. While you'll see an improvement from the M4 model, it's a really significant boost if you have an iPad Pro with an M3 chip or older. 

Then there's the other bits and bobs we liked, such as its extremely thin and lightweight design. It also has Apple Intelligence and an ultra retina XDR display — the screen is really great overall. Plus, the iPad Pro finally supports fast charging, so a 60W power adaptor should get you to 50 percent in just a half hour.
