summary: Kelly Reichardt has been called one of America's greatest filmmakers, and also one of its quietest. But her latest, The Mastermind, centered on an art heist that goes off the rails, is probably her loudest movie yet and definitely her biggest budget to date. Reichardt even set out to make something different from her previous work - which includes First Cow, Showing Up, and Wendy and Lucy - only to get back to the editing room and realize, "Oh, there it is. Another one of these films." Naturally, Reichardt's crime movie is a character study about a man trying to charm his way out of failure.
