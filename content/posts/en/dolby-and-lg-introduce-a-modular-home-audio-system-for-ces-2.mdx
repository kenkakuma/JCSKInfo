LG is teaming up with Dolby for a new collection of speakers that the companies are unveiling ahead of CES 2026. The LG Sound Suite features a modular lineup the H7 soundbar, M7 and M5 wireless surround speakers and the W7 subwoofer. The speakers can be combined in more than two dozen different configurations, from a pair to a full 13.1.7 channel surround sound home theater setup.

The main pitch of the LG Sound Suite is its application of Dolby Atmos FlexConnect. This is the audio brand's tech for optimizing sound from wherever wireless speakers are placed. It's meant to deliver optimal sound even from unusual locations, even when you're limited by outlet locations, furniture placement or other quirks of a room's layout. The collaboration with LG brings FlexConnect to a soundbar for the first time. When the H7 soundbar is used as the lead device, the suite will bring Dolby Atmos FlexConnect audio to any television. In a future software update, LG will also bring support for Dolby Atmos FlexConnect directly to some of its premium TVs, including select 2025 models.
