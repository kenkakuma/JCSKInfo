We've been monitoring the upcoming rock climbing game [_Cairn_](https://www.engadget.com/the-game-bakers-cairn-turns-mountain-climbing-into-a-boss-rush-220638117.html) for several months, as have the many folks who've already enjoyed the demo — which has an impressive 99 percent rating on Steam. In September, developer The Game Bakers [pushed back](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/survival-climbing-game-cairn-has-been-delayed-until-2026-171512591.html) the game's planned 2025 debut to give some extra time for polish. Today, the team dropped a fresh trailer announcing the revised launch date for the project. _Cairn_ will be available on January 29, 2026 for Steam and PlayStation 5 for $30.

The Game Bakers have a solid track record of indie gems, often with a strong, unique sense of place and character. The survival-climbing experience seems like an excellent new topic for the team behind games including [_Haven_](https://www.engadget.com/haven-rpg-nintendo-switch-ps4-epic-game-store-182515301.html) and [_Furi_](https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-furi-for-xbox-one.html). _Cairn_ captures the intensity of winding your way up a mountain and paints a psychological portrait of the people who are drawn to tackling that mental and physical challenge. And if you find the basic gameplay isn't difficult enough, there will also be a [free solo mode](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/climbing-game-cairn-will-have-a-free-solo-mode-with-no-rope-213450638.html) for channelling your inner daredevil without ropes.
