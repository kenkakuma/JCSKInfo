The [Commodore 64](https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-19-commodore-usa-begins-shipping-replica-c64s-next-week-fulfilling.html) is back in black, sort of. Retro Games and Plaion Replai released a limited edition redesign of the best-selling computer, called [THEC64 - Black Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQQS17Xw9E). Like its name suggests, the console is a modernized version of the classic Commodore 64 in an all-black shell.

THEC64 - Black Edition will come with 25 pre-installed games, but unlike the company's previous consoles, this one will feature "neo-retro" games from C64 developers who have designed new games on the old-school architecture. Once you finish all the new titles like _Sam's Journey_, _A Pig Quest_ and _Hessian_, you can plug in your own USB drive to play custom games. According to Retro Games, the updated redesign comes with four save slots per game, plug-and-play HDMI compatibility and a USB joystick.

If you want THEC64 - Black Edition to feel more like the original Commodore 64, you can plug in a keyboard through the USB port. However, Retro Games also designed a non-mini THEC64 that has a fully functional keyboard. The latest blacked-out version is now available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF) or [Retro Games' website](https://retrogames.biz/products/thec64-mini-black/) for $119.99.
