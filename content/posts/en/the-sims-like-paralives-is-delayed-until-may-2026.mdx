Folks who are looking forward to a fresh flavor of life simulation in the form of _Paralives_ will have to wait a while longer before they can jump into the Sims-like game. The game was [supposed to hit early access](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-sims-like-paralives-hits-early-access-in-december-220014257.html) on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/) on December 8, but lead developer Alex Massé and the team at Paralives Studio have pushed back the release date to May 25.

[Massé explained](https://x.com/ParalivesGame/status/1989347579856113871) that the team expanded its playtests in the lead up to the early access period, "and the latest feedback we received made us realize the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release." While the character creator and in-depth home builder modes seem to be in a solid place, playtesters encountered "impactful bugs" in the live mode and it appears that there isn't yet quite enough to do in the town. "We feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community," Massé wrote. The team plans to improve the game's onboarding experience too.

_Paralives_ has been in development for six years, and the team has grown from two or three people in the first couple of years to an average of 10. Having such a small team meant that the developers "had to alternate long stretches of development” between the three parts of the game, Massé wrote. "We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game. This would ensure _Paralives_ offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."

Paralives Studio will stream 45 minutes of gameplay on its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Paralives) at noon ET on November 25. Massé said you'll get to see what the game looks like now, including some of the current features. The team will provide more details on aspects it plans to improve before the early access release. You can expect more streams and videos in the coming months. It's expected that _Paralives_ will remain in early access for two years while the team adds the features and content it plans to.

_Paralives_ is an indie alternative to the likes of The Sims and _InZOI_. There are other life sim games on the way before _Paralives_ debuts, such as [_Pokémon Pokopia_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-an-animal-crossing-esque-life-sim-will-hit-switch-2-on-march-5-160000254.html). _Animal Crossing New Horizons_ is [getting a major update](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/a-switch-2-edition-of-animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-land-on-january-15-135000347.html) and a Switch 2 version in January. However, EA will [shut down](http://engadget.com/gaming/ea-will-shut-down-the-sims-mobile-in-january-173958279.html) _The Sims Mobile_ that same month.
