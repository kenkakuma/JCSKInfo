TikTok is the latest social platform to hand users more control over the amount of AI-generated content they see. The app is experimenting with a new setting that will allow users to request to "see less" AI in their "For You" feed.

The new toggle will be available in “the coming weeks” in the app's "[manage topics](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-making-it-easier-to-control-what-is-and-isnt-in-your-for-you-feed-175301931.html)" section that lets people personalize the types of videos more likely to appear in their feed. In a blog post, TikTok says the control is meant to help users "dial things down" if they want to see less AI content in their recommendations. The update follows a similar move [from Pinterest](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/pinterest-will-let-you-dial-down-ai-slop-in-your-feeds-130000337.html), which has faced complaints about AI slop drowning out authentic images on the platform.

TikTok, like most other platforms, has seen an influx of AI-generated content in recent years. The company, which requires users to label such creations, says that there are more than 1.3 billion videos with these labels. At the same time, the company notes that its existing methods for detecting AI content aren't perfect, Currently, TikTok relies on a widely-used watermarking system called [Content Credentials](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy?lang=en) that adds metadata to AI-generated content. But these signals can get harder to detect when images or videos are edited in other apps or copied and reshared to other sites, as often happens with viral content. 

To address this, TikTok says that it will also experiment with an additional "invisible watermarking" system that could help it identify and label AI content more reliably. "'Invisible watermarks' add another layer of safeguards with a robust technological 'watermark' that only we can read, making it harder for others to remove," the company explained.
