Rockstar Games, developer of _Grand Theft Auto VI_, has been accused of deliberately laying off employees who were trying to unionize, [_Bloomberg_ reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?embedded-checkout=true). The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims over 30 employees who were eliminated at the developer's offices in the UK and Canada were either already part of a union or attempting to organize.

"Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry," IWGB President Alex Marshall said in [a blog post](https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/) about the layoffs. "This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."Â 

Besides the disruption of having to find a new job, the union notes that several employees who were let go are particularly vulnerable. "Amongst the staff dismissed were those with visas sponsored by Rockstar and those with medical conditions who will lose access to essential workplace healthcare schemes," the union says. It adds that "all of those dismissed at Rockstar UK were members of the IWGB Game Workers Union discord channel, and appear to have been targeted for this reason." In response to the IWGB's claims, Rockstar's publisher and owner Take-Two Interactive told _Bloomberg_ that the layoffs had nothing to do with union activity and instead were "for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."

Rockstar and Take-Two have come into conflict with employees in the past over their [return-to-office policy](https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-rockstar-games-return-office-1851297508). Take-Two also laid off staff across multiple studios in [2024](https://www.engadget.com/take-two-is-shutting-down-the-studios-behind-rollerdrome-and-kerbal-space-program-2-000253545.html) and [2025](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/civilization-developer-firaxis-is-laying-off-staff-221105604.html), potentially motivated by the decision to [push back the release](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html) of _Grand Theft Auto VI_ to 2026. The game is expected to be [a massive hit](https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale) for the company and the wider industry, which is part of the reason why the IWGB believes the layoffs are motivated by something other than financials.
