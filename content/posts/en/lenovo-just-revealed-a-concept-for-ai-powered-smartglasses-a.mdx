Lenovo just revealed a new smartglasses concept design at [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-when-techs-biggest-conference-starts-on-january-4-120000189.html). The appropriately-named Lenovo AI Glasses Concept promises to transform "how users interact with their surroundings and unifies their workflow."

They look like a standard pair of specs and not all that different from something like [Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html). A pair weighs just 45 grams and the battery lasts eight hours, which is just enough time to get through a standard workday.

The glasses are wirelessly tethered to a smart device, which is what does most of the computational heavy lifting. They do include Lenovo and Motorola's proprietary AI platform called Qira, which delivers "sub-millisecond live translation and intelligent image recognition." There's also something called the Catch Me Up feature, which is an AI-generated recap of various notifications from various devices.

The hardware allows for touch and voice control and includes teleprompter software. The concept glasses include speakers, as Lenovo is advertising music playback as a feature.

We don't know when or if these smart glasses will ever hit store shelves. Lenovo tends to drop several intriguing concept designs [each year at CES](https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-lenovos-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004053.html) and not all of them make it to market.
