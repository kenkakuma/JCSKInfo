Amazon is selling [three months of Audible for just $3](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=1c0b3a26-9b3b-4971-a5c7-65f04653d525&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=three+months+of+Audible+for+just+%243&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHA_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWMwYjNhMjYtOWIzYi00OTcxLWE1YzctNjVmMDQ2NTNkNTI1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2h6L2F1ZGlibGUvYXJ5YS9tbHAiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAUQqCgpFbvc2l0aR-BpzSekE0S8jSztA3KGJbmbkPdew&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp) in honor of Black Friday. The company typically reserves [this sale for Prime Day](https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-three-months-of-audible-for-only-3-with-this-prime-day-deal-090052863.html), so it's nice to see the deal make an unexpected return.

This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That's not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still.

Audible has a diverse catalog that [goes beyond audiobooks](https://www.engadget.com/audible-is-testing-book-recommendations-based-on-your-prime-video-habits-123053133.html). It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases. Users also get unlimited access to the Plus Catalog, which houses thousands of audiobooks. Finally, active members get discounts on many audiobooks when looking to purchase.

Winter is coming and this is a good way to make sure you have plenty to listen to throughout the next three months. This deal does have a time limit. It expires on December 16.
