Amazon MGM just released the final trailer for its upcoming film starring Ryan Gosling, _Project Hail Mary_, and it provides our first good look at his five-legged alien co-star, Rocky. The movie adapts a 2021 Andy Weir (_The Martian_) novel of the same name, and follows Dr. Ryland Grace, a scientist who wakes up on a spacecraft far from Earth with no recollection of how he got there or why, only to discover he's on a seemingly impossible mission to stop an extinction event. 

If you've read the book, you already know we're in for an emotional rollercoaster with this one, and the latest trailer aptly tugs at our heartstrings with a glimpse of the friendship that grows between Grace and an alien he meets after waking up — and the incredibly high stakes they're facing. The movie will be released nationwide on March 20, but [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/project-hail-mary-early-movie-tickets-prime-members) announced alongside this trailer that it'll be offering tickets for early screenings in premium formats including IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX and 70MM to Prime members. Those screenings will begin on March 16, and tickets go on sale February 20 through Fandango.
