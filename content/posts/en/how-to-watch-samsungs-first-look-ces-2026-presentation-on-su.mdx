Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators, AI assistants and rolling robots. But for [CES 2026](http://google.com/url?q=https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1766177037453611&usg=AOvVaw2s0tafHDwWnqYKUQHC4zuC), the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation.

Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping hints about what's on the agenda, but what we're really hoping to see is an update on the [Ballie robot](https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html) — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised [2025 release date](https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsungs-cute-ballie-robot-arrives-this-summer-with-google-gemini-in-tow-133658886.html).

## How to watch Samsung's "The First Look" presentation at CES 2026

The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the [Samsung Newsroom](https://news.samsung.com/global/), [Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung) or via Samsung TV Plus. (We'll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)

## What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026

Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company's plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include "new AI-driven customer experiences," the company [said in a press release](https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-event-at-ces-2026-the-first-look). In addition, we'll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will "share their respective business directions for the upcoming year."

But if you're looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its "Advent calendar" approach to early CES announcements, with [new press releases](https://news.samsung.com/global/) dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors [LG](https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html) and [Hisense](https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html) — the company will be offering details on a line of [micro RGB TVs](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html) (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls [Bespoke AI](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-new-ai-connected-living-lineup-at-ces-2026). Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, [Music Studio 5 and 7](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html), at CES this year. Additionally, it'll debut its latest [Freestyle+ portable projector](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html).

Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the [Odyssey gaming monitor](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html). It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen _and_ has glasses-free 3D. It's likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.

Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we'll keep updating this story as it does.
