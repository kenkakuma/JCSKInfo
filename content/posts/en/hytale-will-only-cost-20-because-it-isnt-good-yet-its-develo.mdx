_Hytale_, a more action-packed take on _Minecraft_, will be available for $20 when it relaunches in early access, Hypixel Studios [announced on X](https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023?s=20). The developer shared that it planned to relaunch _Hytale_ earlier this week after successfully [reacquiring the rights to the game](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-buys-its-ip-from-riot-so-hytale-is-back-in-development-185040959.html) from Riot Games.

Alongside its $20 "Standard" edition, Hypixel also plans to offer $35 "Supporter" and $70 "Cursebreaker" editions of _Hytale_ with additional in-game cosmetics. Pricing the game at $20 is an acknowledgement of how unfinished it is, according to Hypixel Studios co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme. "I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," Collins-Laflamme said [in an X post.](https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781?s=20) "The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet."

> I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible. I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise.

Hypixel Studios [shared footage](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hypixel-studios-shows-off-new-hytale-footage-the-day-after-it-brought-the-game-back-to-life-173159607.html) of _Hytale_ the day after it announced its deal with Riot Games. The game was [originally cancelled by Riot](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-and-ends-development-of-hytale-190435047.html) in June 2025, after five years of development and "a major reboot of the game engine," Hypixel CEO Aaron Donaghey said at the time. 

Riot Games [bought Hypixel Studios](https://www.engadget.com/riot-buys-hypixel-studios-hytale-171845047.html) during a period of expansion that included [the launch](https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-06-riot-games-riot-forge-league-of-legends.html) of the company's publishing label Riot Forge, which was responsible for _League of Legends_ spinoffs like [_Ruined King: A League of Legends Story_](https://www.engadget.com/riot-forge-ruined-king-league-of-legends-story-convergence-song-of-nunu-171823703.html). Riot eventually [decided to sunset Riot Forge](https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-is-laying-off-11-percent-of-its-workforce-globally-022034243.html) in 2024, alongside mass layoffs at the studio.
