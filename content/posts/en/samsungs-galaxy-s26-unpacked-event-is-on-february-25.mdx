After kicking off CES 2026 with its ["First Look" event](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html), Samsung is ready to announce the first of what should be several new Galaxy smartphones this year. The company [is officially hosting](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-february-2026-next-ai-phone-makes-life-easier/) a Galaxy Unpacked event on February 25 at 1PM ET, where it'll introduce the Galaxy S26 series and updates to Galaxy AI.

Leaks that have trickled out ahead of the event suggest that the Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra will feature a new [Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/qualcomms-new-flagship-mobile-platform-is-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-060427445.html) chip, and could come with [more RAM and storage](https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1994663953180627176?s=20). Only the [Galaxy S26 Ultra](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/galaxy-s26-ultra-will-look-more-premium-than-the-s25-ultra.html) is expected to include major hardware changes, though, with an updated camera system, and possibly proper support for Qi2 charging. Alongside new smartphones, Samsung is also expected to introduce the [Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro](https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-4-pro-hints-surface-alongside-a-bunch-of-other-unreleased-products/), which will reportedly feature a new design, support for head gestures and an Ultra Wideband chip so they're easier to find using Google Find Hub.

As in previous years, Samsung has an optional deal for anyone who wants to lock in a discount before the company's new smartphones and accessories are announced. If you [reserve Samsung's new devices now](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!DlHVWGGkQTiTvx3KcI7245QRkY8BUegdJzmzShIy5Vo-yygi_lcQJ69XoawatQShNpymKq1STJ_T09PNr9Qngh5ttUwJb3Zc$), you can receive a $30 credit and be entered to win a $5,000 Samsung.com gift card. When you do pre-order, the company also claims that it'll offer up to an additional $900 in savings if you trade-in a device or $150 off even without a trade-in if you pre-order through Samsung.com.

Engadget will have coverage of everything Samsung announces at Galaxy Unpacked right here, but if you want to watch along, you can catch the company's livestream of the event on [Samsung's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/samsung), the [Samsung Newsroom](https://news.samsung.com/global/) page or at [Samsung.com](http://samsung.com).
