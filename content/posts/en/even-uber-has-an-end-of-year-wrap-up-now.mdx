End-of-year wrap-ups were popularized by [Spotify](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2025-is-here-and-now-its-a-competition-130052418.html), and these days you can look back on the last 12 months of listening with most of the [music](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/apple-music-replay-2025-is-here-to-highlight-your-unimpeachable-music-taste-151224318.html) streaming [apps](https://www.engadget.com/apps/amazon-musics-year-end-recap-arrives-today-130029446.html), as well as your [gaming](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstations-2025-wrap-up-is-here-so-you-can-see-how-many-hours-youve-sunk-into-death-stranding-2-191508693.html) and [YouTube](https://www.engadget.com/apps/youtube-just-introduced-a-yearly-recap-of-your-watched-videos-140016460.html) viewing habits. The next logical step? A full recap of all of the Uber trips and takeaways you’ve guiltily ordered this year, of course!

Uber is calling its new wrap-up feature, which launches today, "YOUBER", and it takes into consideration both your Uber and Uber Eats usage. You can see where you went, how often you demanded Uber Comfort, and how frequently you returned to the same pizza place on Uber Eats. If you rank in the top one percent of a specific restaurant’s customers, YOUBER is going to tell you all about it, whether the realization fills you with shame or not.

There are also 14 "Uber Personality Profiles" that you could be assigned, such as "Do-Gooder" for the Uber Electric loyalists, "Rise & Shiner" for the early morning riders, and "Delivery Darling" for those who "live for deliveries of all kinds." Uber lets you share your results straight from YOUBER using the "Share this Story" button from within the app.

YOUBER is available to Uber and Uber Eats customers in the US from today, and can be accessed from your homescreen or account page.
