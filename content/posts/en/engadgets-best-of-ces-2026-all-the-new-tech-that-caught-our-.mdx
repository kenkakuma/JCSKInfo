Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, [was out in full force](https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-and-gadget-reveals-during-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146751.html) covering the show. The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.

More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It's appropriate, I guess, that as we're beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry's insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI's supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.

We're by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it's fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA's marathon keynote and Lenovo's somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it's been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of [weird new gadgets](https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html), appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.

Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.

If you've been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there's still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — _Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief_

## Best robot: Switchbot Onero H1

![Onero H1 robot](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_onero.jpg)

Onero H1 robot

Onero

We saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot's Onero H1, which [we watched pick up clothes](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html) and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year. 

The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It's also kind of cute. The company hasn't said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we'll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — _Karissa Bell, Senior reporter_

## Best accessibility tech: WheelMove

![WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_wheelmove.jpg)

WheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairs

Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget

[WheelMove](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html) offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It's portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.

This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn't overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. _— Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editor_

## Best TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)

![LG OLED Evo W6 "Wallpaper TV"](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lg.jpg)

LG OLED Evo W6 "Wallpaper TV"

LG

I’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like [LG’s OLED Evo W6](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html). It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.

And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. _— Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporter_

## Best AI hardware: Subtle Voicebuds

![Subtle Voicebuds](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_voicebuds.jpg)

Subtle Voicebuds

Subtle

[Subtle’s Voicebuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-subtle-voicebuds-use-ai-to-transcribe-your-words-below-a-whisper-or-in-very-loud-spaces-like-the-ces-show-floor-000000019.html) are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it's below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, _and_ you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.

While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. _— Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporter_

## Best smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart home

![IKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb range](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikeabestof2.jpg)

IKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb range

IKEA

The best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots. It seems every other company, from [Bosch](https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-todays-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020554.html) to [LG](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html) to [Samsung](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-unveiled-ai-powered-products-at-ces-2026-everything-announced-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059247.html), had one or both of the buzzy technologies baked into their new smart home offerings. But [IKEA](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikeas-first-ces-appearance-included-a-6-matter-smart-bulb-172623474.html) came to its first CES with a simple lineup of basic, Matter-enabled smart plugs, sensors, lamps and remotes at screamingly good prices. Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff.  

There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own [DIRIGERA](https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-todays-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020554.html) or use a Matter hub you already own. The new lineup should land at IKEA’s website and stores sometime in January. _— Amy Skorheim, Senior reporter_

## Best home theater: Samsung HW-QS90H

![Samsung HW-QS90H soundbar](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_samsungsb.jpg)

Samsung HW-QS90H soundbar

Billy Steele for Engadget

Many companies claim their soundbars have enough bass that you don’t need a separate subwoofer. Those promises rarely pan out, even when the company [devises new technology](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-arc-ultra-review-new-tech-powers-a-big-audio-upgrade-130011149.html) to solve the problem. With [the HW-QS90H](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html), Samsung is pledging to do the same with its Quad Bass woofer system. Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. _— Billy Steele, Deputy editor_

## Best audio: Shokz OpenFit Pro

![Shokz OpenFit Pro](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_shokz.jpg)

Shokz OpenFit Pro

Shokz

When it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off. Shokz is one of the few that has cracked the code with its [OpenFit Pro](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/preview-shokz-debuts-openfit-pro-earbuds-at-ces-that-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-002401712.html?feature=preview&preview=true&feature.preview=1&query_ncp=1). The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. _— Billy Steele, Deputy editor_

## Best outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1

![Tone Outdoors T1](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_tone.jpg)

Tone Outdoors T1

Whisper Aero

Outdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear. Tone Outdoors isn’t your usual power tool outfit though; it’s a spin-off of the aerospace engineering company Whisper Aero. Through its development of quieter electric airplane engines, Whisper Aero realized its technology had other uses. Enter [the T1](https://www.engadget.com/home/ces-2026-the-tone-outdoors-t1-solved-the-biggest-problem-with-leaf-blowers-234309500.html) leaf blower.

The T1 is significantly quieter than most handheld gas models, clocking in at just 52 decibels of peak noise on average. It’s also more powerful than most of them with 880 CFM of airflow volume. The T1 can run longer too, and an upcoming backpack will extend run time for several hours. But the most important advancement here is not annoying your neighbors — or yourself — when it’s time to do some yard work. — _Billy Steele, Deputy editor_

## Best toy: Lego Smart Play

![Lego Smart Play](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lego2.jpg)

Lego Smart Play

Lego

Lego is constantly evolving, but rarely does it make as big a move as it did with [Smart Play](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html). The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life. 

The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego's Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader's TIE fighter, and you'll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don't need to know how it works — it just does. — _Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editor_

## Best PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16

![The Dell XPS 14 and 16.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_xps.jpg)

The Dell XPS 14 and 16.

Dell

In a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself. Last year, Dell showed up with a [new naming scheme for all of its hardware](https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html) that included replacing the iconic XPS line with the word “Premium.” And [despite our objections](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html), the company followed through with the rebrand. But now at CES 2026, not only [has Dell admitted its mistake](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html), it’s righting wrongs with [two new members of the XPS family](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html) that are exactly what we wanted all along.

On the XPS 14 and XPS 16, we’re getting brand new chassis featuring the latest chips from Intel, gorgeous tandem OLED displays and precision engineering that embodies everything we loved about XPS laptops from previous years. Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor. 

But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet. There are also placeholders for two more XPS models slated to arrive in the not too distant future. — _Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter_

## Best health tech: Eyebot vision test booth

![Eyebot vision test](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestofeyebot.jpg)

Eyebot vision test

Eyebot

Wouldn’t it be nice if getting an updated eyeglasses prescription wasn’t as lengthy a process as it is right now? [Eyebot’s new kiosk](https://www.engadget.com/general/eyebot-promises-an-accurate-vision-test-in-a-couple-of-minutes-160000184.html) is designed to automate the process of visiting a doctor’s office to three minutes rocking up to a machine. It uses a combination of analog and digital wizardry to identify what you need to see properly in no time at all. Even better is that the prescriptions have to be signed off by a licensed eye doctor, so you can still rely on a degree of professional rigor. We like Eyebot because it proved itself in our tests: its brief examination matched my professionally completed prescription from last year. But its ability to make effective eye care accessible and affordable in a way that it isn’t at present is even more compelling than the tech itself. — _Daniel Cooper, Senior reporter_

## Best gaming tech: ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo

![ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_asus.jpg)

ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo

ASUS

The [ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html) is big, weird and potentially awkward to set up. But honestly, what kind of gamer doesn’t want more screens? Even if you can’t use its second display in the middle of a firefight, more real estate means extra room for Discord, build guides or anything else you might need. Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos. You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — _Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter_

## Best mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold

![Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_trifold.jpg)

Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold

Sam Rutherford for Engadget

Samsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the [Galaxy Z TriFold](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html) in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor. 

The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.

It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — _Mat Smith, UK bureau chief_

## Most promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable

![Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lenovo.jpg)

Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable

Lenovo

Concept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market. But with the [Legion Pro Rollable concept](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html), Lenovo created something with a simple yet powerful premise: A gaming laptop with a screen that gets wider at the touch of a button.

To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo took a regular Legion Pro 7i and then swapped its standard 16-inch display for a flexible one that can expand all the way up to 23.8 inches — with a bonus stop in between. This means you have the option to choose from 16:10, 21:9 or even 24:9 depending on the situation, which feels like an incredible way to enhance racing games, flight sims and anything else that can take advantage of extra wide aspect ratios. Granted, when its screen is fully deployed, it does look a bit ungainly. But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — _Sam Rutherford, Senior reporter_

## Best emerging technology: IXI autofocus lenses

![IXI Autofocus lenses](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_ixi.jpg)

IXI Autofocus lenses

IXI

[IXI’s autofocusing glasses](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html) were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user's eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds. Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription. Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.

IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe. The company has a busy year ahead as it turns its technology into a consumer product. — _Mat Smith, UK bureau chief_

## Best in show: Lego Smart Play

![Lego Smart Play](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_lego.jpg)

Lego Smart Play

Lego

There's perhaps no place better than CES to highlight how quickly industry trends die. Over the years the show has been a driver of cornerstone technologies like the VCR, DVD, flatscreen TVs, PDAs and more. Some trends stick, some don't.

Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product: The company's core concept of creative play has remained in place throughout its long history, boosted by a gradual and ongoing evolution of block types and brand tie-ins.

Announced at its first-ever CES press conference, [Smart Play](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html) represents a thoughtful integration of technology to the classic toy. A tiny chip the size of a single Lego stud allows the company's Smart Bricks to sense what's around them, opening up new ways to play. The system will debut with a trio of Star Wars sets, but we’re sure Lego has plans for a wide range of licensed and unlicensed options.

Our team instantly fell in love with Smart Play, and Deputy editor Nathan Ingraham had the opportunity to both build some sets and talk with some of the people behind the technology. Amid parental anxieties about screentime, it's refreshing that Smart Play doesn't require an app or a screen to get started. Kids can just get building. — _Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chief_
