Gamers who prefer [physical copies](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-nes-game-jaws-is-getting-a-retro-physical-re-release-on-switch-and-ps5-221052996.html) of their favorite titles may be getting a major win with the Switch 2. In an [unexpected announcement](https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mae7ilx6r22f) from retro video game publisher ININ Games, Nintendo reportedly has "two new smaller cartridge sizes" for its Switch 2 console. For ININ Games, these rumored game cartridges with smaller storage capacity allow the publisher to recalculate production costs and pursue a [physical Switch 2 release](https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002060129512947968?s=20) of its upcoming _R-Type Dimensions III._

ININ Games later deleted its posts mentioning these smaller Switch 2 cartridges and issued a correction on its website and [social media pages](https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721). However, the publisher reiterated that _R-Type Dimensions III_ will be released on a physical cartridge, but that "no further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed."

"There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities," ININ Games said in a statement. "Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo."

If we're reading between the lines, ININ Games may have been early to tease a crucial detail about Switch 2 cartridges that Nintendo wasn't officially ready to reveal yet. For more context, Nintendo reportedly only offers physical game cartridges for Switch 2 with a 64GB capacity. With less demanding games like _R-Type Dimensions III_, that much storage capacity could be unnecessary and raise production costs. Nintendo still hasn't made an announcement about these potential smaller cartridges, but we could see a lot more game publishers opting for physical copies of their upcoming games if they are indeed an option.
