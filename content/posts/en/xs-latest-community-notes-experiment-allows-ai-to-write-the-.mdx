X is experimenting with a new way for AI to write Community Notes. The company is testing a new "[collaborative notes](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/contributing/collaborative-notes)" feature that allows human writers to request an AI-written Community Note. 

It's not the first time the platform has experimented with AI in Community Notes. The company started a [pilot program](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-will-let-ai-write-community-notes-220130039.html) last year to allow developers to create dedicated AI note writers.  X’s Keith Coleman [tells me](https://x.com/kcoleman/status/2019528080729969105) that AI writers are “prolific” and that one has contributed more than 1,000 notes that were rates as helpful by other contributors. But the latest experiment sounds like a more streamlined process.

According to the company, when an existing Community Note contributor requests a note on a post, the request "now also kicks off creation of a Collaborative Note." Contributors can then rate the note or suggest improvements. "Collaborative Notes can update over time as suggestions and ratings come in," X says. "When considering an update, the system reviews new input from contributors to make the note as helpful as possible, then decides whether the new version is a meaningful improvement."

According to Coleman, who oversees Community Notes, the AI writer for collaborative notes will be Grok. That would be in-line with how a lot of X users currently invoke the AI on threads with replies like "@grok is this true?" But Coleman says that “if it works well, it could make sense to bring the suggestion-feedback loop to the AI note writer API as well.”

[](http://well.Community)Community Notes has often been criticized for moving too slowly so adding AI into the mix could help speed up the process of getting notes published. Cleman also noted that the update also provides "a new way to make models smarter in the process (continuous learning from community feedback)." On the other hand, we don't have to look very far to find examples of Grok [losing touch with reality](https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-blames-adversarial-prompting-after-grok-spewed-embarrassing-sycophantic-praise-235157807.html) or [worse](https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html). 

According to X, only Community Note Contributors with a "[top writer](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/contributing/top-contributors)" status will be able to initiate a collaborative note to start, though it expects to expand availability "over time."
