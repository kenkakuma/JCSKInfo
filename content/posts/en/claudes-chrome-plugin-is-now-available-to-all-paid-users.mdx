Anthropic is finally letting more people use [Claude in Google Chrome](https://claude.com/blog/claude-for-chrome). The company's AI browser plugin is [expanding](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2001748044434543082?s=20) beyond $200-per-month [Max](https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html) subscribers and is now available to anyone who pays for a Claude subscription. 

The Claude Chrome plugin allows for easy access to Anthropic's AI regardless of where you are on the web, but its real draw is how it lets Claude navigate and use websites on your behalf. Anthropic says that Claude can fill out forms, manage your calendar and email and complete multi-step workflows based on a prompt. The latest version of the plugin also features integration with Claude Code, Anthropic's AI coding tool, and allows users to record a workflow and "teach" Claude how to do what they want it to do.

Before agents were the buzzword du jour, "computer use," the ability for AI models to [understand and interact with computer interfaces](https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-is-letting-claude-ai-control-your-pc-181500127.html), was a major focus at Anthropic and other AI companies. Now computer use is just one tool in the larger tool bag for agents, but that understanding of what digital buttons to click and how to click them is what makes Claude's Chrome plugin possible.

OpenAI and Perplexity offer similar agentic capabilities in their respective [ChatGPT Atlas](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-launches-on-macos-today-170735742.html) and [Comet](https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-is-available-now-for-200-per-month-180955616.html) browsers. At this point the only AI company not fully setting its AI models loose on a browser is Google. You can access [Gemini in Google Chrome](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-bringing-gemini-to-chrome-so-it-can-answer-questions-about-your-open-tabs-174903787.html) and ask questions about a webpage, but Google hasn't yet let its AI model navigate or use the web on a user's behalf. Those features, first demoed in [Project Mariner](https://www.engadget.com/ai/jarvis-googles-web-browsing-ai-is-now-officially-known-as-project-mariner-191603929.html), are presumably on the way.
