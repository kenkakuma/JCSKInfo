_Battlefield 6_ is getting a [free battle royale mode on October 28](https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155?). This follows [numerous leaks](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dataminers-claim-mysterious-granite-files-related-to-this-weeks-patch-could-be-a-shadowdrop-for-its-battle-royale-mode/) that have been popping up ever since the [mainline game hit store shelves](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-finally-a-trailer-for-battlefield-6-but-no-multiplayer-details-just-yet-170144110.html) on October 10.

It's called _Battlefield: RedSec_, though we don't have too many gameplay details. It's free for everyone and you don't need the full-priced game to play. That much we do know. This puts it in direct competition with Call of Duty's own free-to-play battle royale, _Warzone_.

We can assume some gameplay elements, as it's a battle royale. It'll likely feature players heading to a large map and battling one another until the last person is left standing. You know the drill. EA dropped a short teaser that seems to show four different classes of soldier to choose from.

We don't know how or if this battle royale will interact with the main game. _Warzone_ typically includes a story that ties into whatever's going on with Call of Duty's seasonal content drops. To that end, Season 1 of _Battlefield 6_ also releases on October 28. This update includes new maps, modes, vehicles, guns, attachments and cosmetic items.

_Battlefield: RedSec_ will be available for download on various gaming platforms at 11AM ET. This could end up being a pretty big hit for EA, as the main game managed to sell [7 million copies in three days](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html).
