According to a [statement](https://pirg.org/media-center/statement-congress-strips-bipartisan-military-right-to-repair-provisions-from-defense-bill/) from the Public Interest Research Group, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 has removed language that would have granted the US military the right to repair its own equipment rather than requiring it to use official defense contractors for maintenance. This bill is still being considered by Congress, but it is uncertain whether the right to repair language is likely to be re-introduced once it has been removed. 

"Despite support from Republicans, Democrats, the White House and key military leaders, troops will keep waiting for repairs they could perform themselves," US PIRG Legislative Associate Charlie Schuyler said in a statement from the organization. "Taxpayers will keep paying inflated costs. And in some cases, soldiers might not get the equipment they need when they need it most."

A bipartisan bill from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Sheedy was [introduced](https://www.engadget.com/general/the-military-might-finally-win-the-right-to-repair-173539873.html) earlier this year to allow the military right to repair access. The topic has been a more piecemeal affair for laypeople in the US, with some states [enacting](https://www.engadget.com/oregons-right-to-repair-bill-is-now-a-law-064955635.html) their own laws and federal regulators sometimes [intervening](https://www.engadget.com/ftc-warns-some-pc-manufacturers-that-theyre-violating-right-to-repair-rules-120009736.html) to offer consumers more choice in how they seek repairs.
