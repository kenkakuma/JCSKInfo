Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. This week saw the arrival of some fairly high-profile ports, a relaxing garden creation game and much more. I've even managed to tear myself away from _Football Manager 26_ for long enough to tell you about some of them.

Barely a week goes by without a fun theme event taking place on Steam and one that runs until November 10 is also going down on the [Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/fusion-festival/#sort=df&p=0). The [Metroidvania Fusion Festival](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45063983/sale/MetroidvaniaFusionFestival) is a celebration of — what else? — the broad spectrum of Metroidvania games. It features 245 projects, including upcoming games and demos, and a sale with discounts of up to 90 percent. 

I've grabbed a few demos to check out this weekend, including [_Key Fairy_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/) (a pacifist bullet-hell game that sees you grappling and dancing your way around enemies), [_Echo Weaver_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184080/Echo_Weaver/) (a time-loop puzzler that I've [mentioned before](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playdate-season-two-spray-paint-simulator-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110035699.html)) and 2D platformer [Little Ghost](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587380/Little_Ghost/), in which you explore a mixed media world as a cute specter.

In terms of deals, [_Blasphemous_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous) is 75 percent off, [_Blasphemous II_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2114740/Blasphemous_2/) is half off, 2D action game [_Gunbrella_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1580180/Gunbrella/) (which I've had on my wishlist for years) is 65 percent off and body horror delight [_Carrion_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953490/CARRION/) is 22 percent off. I can wholeheartedly recommend [_Turbo Kid_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733250/Turbo_Kid/), a quasi-sequel to one of my favorite films of the same name. That's 35 percent off in this sale.

Elsewhere this week, I read a solid profile of developer Lente Cuenen in the [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/02/arts/spilled-lente-cuenen.html). Cuenen is the developer of [_Spilled!_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/), a relaxing waterway cleanup game I've been meaning to check out for a while. The piece is an intriguing look into the life of Cuenen, who makes games about boats while living on her boat in the Netherlands.

## New releases

A couple of notable indies made the leap onto Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 this week, including [_1000xResist_](https://www.engadget.com/indie-darling-1000xresist-heads-to-xbox-and-playstation-on-november-4-212654512.html). This narrative-driven sci-fi adventure from Sunset Visitor and publisher Fellow Traveller Games earned widespread acclaim when it debuted on Steam and Nintendo Switch last year, particularly for its storytelling, visuals and how it explores various themes. It won a Peabody Award too.

I have yet to dive into _1000xResist_, even though it's been on my PC and Steam Deck for months. [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014524) and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=816490d2-5235-4e73-89dc-f9e9bcd86076&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Microsoft&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS8xMDAweHJlc2lzdC85TlBETjlSNDVKWDQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgxNjQ5MGQyLTUyMzUtNGU3My04OWRjLWY5ZTliY2Q4NjA3NiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvMTAwMHhyZXNpc3QvOU5QRE45UjQ1Slg0In0&signature=AQAAAQxVaKtWYp2TjpKvncsjbykIPQ9bcz_LeU-GrYiZlM_H&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2F1000xresist%2F9NPDN9R45JX4) players now have the chance to jump in as well. What's more, _1000xResist_ is on Game Pass Premium, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

A little over a year after releasing the full version of the _Satisfactory_ on PC, Coffee Stain Studios and Coffee Stain Publishing have brought the multi-million-selling factory builder to [PS5](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008447) and [Xbox Series X/S](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=816490d2-5235-4e73-89dc-f9e9bcd86076&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Microsoft&linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9zYXRpc2ZhY3RvcnkvOW5wcjJjZzZzOTVxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4MTY0OTBkMi01MjM1LTRlNzMtODlkYy1mOWU5YmNkODYwNzYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL3NhdGlzZmFjdG9yeS85bnByMmNnNnM5NXEifQ&signature=AQAAAe18ET-roOzcBb10ELqf1Jc4q3BLJta3yEbautpSewzQ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fsatisfactory%2F9npr2cg6s95q). You can play solo or with friends as you construct factories on an alien planet. You'll explore the planet to find resources and maybe even engage in a little combat.

In general, both critics and players have rated _Satisfactory_ highly. Some might say it’s more than satisfactory.

_Pools_ was one of my favorite games of last year. It's a disquieting walking simulator, an eerie journey through a liminal space. I could almost smell the chlorine as I explored the mazy swimming pool-inspired environments. It's more eerie than downright scary. Developer Tensori brought the experience to [iPhone, iPad and Mac](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=816490d2-5235-4e73-89dc-f9e9bcd86076&featureId=text-link&linkText=iPhone%2C+iPad+and+Mac&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL2NhL2FwcC9wb29scy9pZDY2NzA3OTI4NzgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgxNjQ5MGQyLTUyMzUtNGU3My04OWRjLWY5ZTliY2Q4NjA3NiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS9jYS9hcHAvcG9vbHMvaWQ2NjcwNzkyODc4In0&signature=AQAAAbVxqflY8LTiCFhaxa0B3-5WJiSuM0ulc2gMn0bs5WuR&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fca%2Fapp%2Fpools%2Fid6670792878) this week. The iPad version also works on Apple Vision Pro. 

To that end, a virtual reality version of _Pools_ is coming to PS VR2 on November 25. You'll be able to check it out in flatscreen on PS5 on the same day.

[_Thrasher_](https://www.engadget.com/thrasher-the-psychedelic-game-from-the-artist-behind-thumper-arrives-in-july-133026724.html) is the latest title from Brian Gibson, the artist and composer of the intense rhythm game [_Thumper_](https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-10-thumper-might-just-be-the-most-intense-vr-game-yet.html) (and also the bassist for the noise rock band Lightning Bolt). The arcade action game debuted on Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro last year. It made the leap to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702300/THRASHER) (and SteamVR) this week, so you can now play it on a flatscreen for the first time.

_Thrasher_ is a very trippy-looking game from developer Puddle and publisher Creature Label. It seems like quite the wild ride and it was named Apple's Vision Pro game of the year for 2024. For what it’s worth. the team behind _Thrasher_ says that the game runs at 90 fps on Steam Deck.

Here's a completely different change of pace. _Dream Garden_ is all about creating a relaxing garden space for yourself. You can use hills, rivers, ponds and pebbles to shape the landscape, then add decorations. With the rake tool, you can trace patterns in the sand. 

There are no limits or timers in this Japanese-inspired game from the duo at Campfire Studio. _Dream Garden_ is out now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3367600/Dream_Garden/).

_The Falconeer_ first took flight five years ago — it was an [Xbox Series X/S launch title](https://www.engadget.com/the-falconeer-xbox-series-x-day-one-160037062.html), fact fans. A new edition for Steam called _The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster_ is a complete rework, as solo developer Tomas Sala rebuilt the game from the ground up. It features new tech, overhauled and expanded environments, gameplay upgrades and all of the previous DLC.

I'm glad to hear that Sala has improved the flight mechanics. I found it a bit tough to get to grips with the aerial combat when I played _The Falconeer_ back in 2020, but I enjoyed it otherwise. 

The remastered version (which looks much grander in scope than the original game) is available as a free upgrade for existing owners on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135260/The_Falconeer_Revolution_Remaster/). Everyone else can hop in for free until 1PM ET on November 10. While the remaster is now the default option, you'll still be able to access the original version of _The Falconeer_ via a dedicated Steam branch, Hooray for game preservation!

## Upcoming 

It wouldn't be an edition of our weekly indie roundup without a dog game, would it? You can play _Sheepherds!_ solo, but Ultimo Disco primarily designed it as a party game for couch co-op or online multiplayer. 

It is, as the name suggests, a sheepherding game in which you'll corral flocks of sheep to shear their wool. You can earn cosmetic items and outfits for your pooch, and bump up the difficulty with optional challenges if you like. [_Sheepherds!_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3006280/Sheepherds/) is coming to Steam on November 17.

We're big fans of the [Playdate](https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html) around these parts and it's always fun to learn about new games that are coming to the wonderful little handheld. Panic [held a showcase this week](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-playdate-showcase-is-set-for-november-6-210034162.html) to shine a spotlight on some upcoming games, as well as others included in the [fall sale](https://play.date/games/tags/on-sale/) that runs until November 13.

_Fauna_ is Cadin Batrack's follow up to Playdate comics _The Botanist_ and _To Dust_. It's choose-your-own-adventure visual novel with a branching narrative, this time set in a near future in which large language models have advanced to the point where humans can talk to animals. The animals use their newfound communication skills to seek equal rights. _Fauna_ seems pretty interesting! It's [coming to Playdate soon](https://play.date/games/fauna/).

Zachary Snyder's _Diora_ is a puzzle adventure that tasks you with discovering a "mysterious force that is manipulating structures and the people around them." At first glance, it reminds me a bit of _Fez_ and the Monument Valley series. _Diora_ will hit Playdate on December 16.
