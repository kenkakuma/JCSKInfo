Even with its US future [in limbo](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/why-dji-drones-might-be-banned-in-the-us-170030273.html), DJI keeps releasing impressive drones. Its latest is the [Neo 2](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-neo-2-selfie-drone-has-lidar-for-obstacle-avoidance-174700215.html), an inexpensive, lightweight model aimed at creators and hobbyists. It’s an upgraded version of [the Neo](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-review-the-best-200-drone-ever-made-010032884.html), an immensely popular drone both in the US and elsewhere. The new model is equally safe and easy to fly thanks to the shrouded props, palm takeoff and voice control.

DJI didn’t just tack on a number and call it a day, though. The Neo 2 is loaded with new features like LiDAR obstacle detection, improved video quality and longer battery life — all at only a slightly higher price. In fact, a couple of the new features can’t even be found on high-end DJI drones.

The original Neo wasn’t perfect; the propellers on that model emitted a banshee-like scream. The lack of obstacle detection and short battery life also wasn’t ideal. Has the company solved these problems on the new model? Mostly, yes — and it’s now a nearly perfect personal drone.

## Design

Though the Neo 2 has the same 6.5-inch square size and friendly appearance as before, there are some important differences. A new LiDAR sensor beside the camera is designed to detect forward obstacles, and is a surprising inclusion for such an affordable drone. On the left front is a small display — a first for a DJI drone — that shows the current shot mode (follow, dronie, etc.).

The gimbal has also been upgraded and can now rotate instead of just tilt. That means the camera will stay level when the drone banks, with no ugly cropping or reduced resolution that I occasionally saw when doing extreme maneuvers with the Neo.

The Neo 2 has three buttons on the side (rather than just one on top as before), along with two new omnidirectional sensors. On top of helping the Neo 2 avoid obstacles, these improve stability in featureless or non-GPS environments like indoors and over water.

Finally, if you buy a Neo 2 with the optional RC-2 or RC-N3 controller, it includes a removable Digital Transceiver with a pair of antennae. Those components give it a butterfly-like appearance and could affect long term durability. However, making them an add-on gave DJI a way to make the basic (non-controller) version as inexpensive as possible.

With all those changes, the Neo 2 is a bit heavier at 5.6 ounces (160 grams) with the Digital Transceiver, compared to 4.8 ounces (135 grams) for the Neo. That’s still easily small enough to slide in a bag and light enough (under 250 grams) that you won’t need to register your drone with the authorities.

## Features

Gesture control is a major new Neo 2 feature not found on other DJI drones. It lets you fly with surprising precision, if you don’t mind looking a little silly. To do so, wave a hand up, down or sideways to climb and bank, move two hands apart or together to make it approach or move away (think pinch-to-zoom in the air), clench a fist to stop it and hold out your palm to land. Gestures can be used in combination with other fly modes so you get the exact shot you want.

Along with the ability to wave your hands, the Neo 2 offers other ways to fly like palm takeoff. After selecting the flight mode (shown on the new display and audibly announced), you can launch the Neo 2 from your hand by pressing the takeoff button or using voice control. It will then execute the chosen mode, fly back to you and land on your outstretched palm.

Smartphone control (not seen on other DJI drones) is available for manual flight. Wi-Fi range has been extended by ten times to 546 yards, compared to 55 yards for the Neo. However, for that range you need a clear signal path with no obstacles between you and the drone. For more precise flight and longer range (up to 6 miles), the Neo 2 supports RC-N2, RC-N3 or RC-2 controllers. And FPV (first person) flying is still an option when using [DJI’s Goggles N3](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-goggles-n3-for-fpv-drones-improve-comfort-and-allow-eyeglasses-130012665.html) or Goggles 3, paired with the RC Motion 3 or FPV Remote Controller 3.

The Neo 3’s Quickshots repertoire has also been updated. A fun new mode is the “[Hitchcock zoom](https://www.videomaker.com/how-to/shooting/composition/the-hitchcock-zoom-its-history-and-how-to-achieve-it/).” When activated, the drone backs away while zooming in at the same time, creating a trippy perspective effect you might’ve seen in _Vertigo_ and _Jaws_. Again, this feature is unique to the Neo 2 in DJI’s lineup.

Other key functions include compatibility with DJI’s microphones, including the Mic 2, [Mic 3](https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-much-smaller-mic-3-can-record-four-subjects-at-once-120032192.html) and [Mic Mini](https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-tiny-mic-mini-offers-high-quality-wireless-sound-recording-starting-at-89-130036583.html). Since the Neo 2 is quieter than the Neo (more on that shortly), noise cancelling requirements are reduced so audio quality is improved. Onboard storage has also been upgraded to 49GB (up from 22GB), letting you record up to 175 minutes of 4K video. At the same time, DJI more than doubled the Wi-Fi transfer speed to 80MB/s.

## Performance

The Neo 2 now has omni sensors and LiDAR for obstacle protectoin

Steve Dent for Engadget

The Neo 2 retains the Neo’s toughness and protection, but it can now fly around obstacles instead of just plowing through them thanks to the LiDAR and sensors. To test that, I used it to follow subjects around trees, buildings and other obstacles. The aim was to see not only how well it avoided crashes in all directions, but to observe how smoothly it tracked while doing so.

To start, I engaged the ActiveTrack follow feature and used the Trace mode “steering wheel’ to follow subjects from the front, sides and back. When flying forward, the Neo 2 avoided most obstacles using its LiDAR, while swooping cinematically around trees and branches. It occasionally failed to detect small twigs and leaves, but unlike [open-prop DJI drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6Ed88dWDlE), it usually flew through them without incident. With just two omni sensors, the Neo 2 is less adept at avoiding obstacles to the sides and rear, however. So if you’re using it to vlog while walking or biking, it’s best to make sure there’s nothing in the way.

With a top speed of just 18 mph, the original Neo was so slow that it could barely track a bike. Luckily, the Neo 2 is much faster with speeds up to 27 mph in follow mode and even has a special “Bicycle Tracking” mode. I tested that on an e-bike and the drone easily kept up with me while easily avoiding obstacles in the forward direction. Again, you need to be extra careful when it’s flying backwards or sideways.

The Neo 2 is as agile as ever, so the extra velocity makes it a better FPV drone as well. While wearing the Goggles N3, I was able to enjoy that sensation of extra speed as it swooped around obstacles. That, plus the low price, makes it a good first drone for anyone looking to get into FPV flying.

I likened the Neo’s prop noise to a banshee howl, but the Neo 2 is maybe a… banshee purr. Both the decibel level and pitch are now tolerable, even indoors. I flew it around at a fairly loud party and hardly anyone noticed; it also didn’t draw much attention in a public park. The only negative is it’s a high-pitched sound, a noise that carries even across high altitudes.

## Video quality

![The DJI Neo 2 now offers 4K video at up to 100 fps](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/ac26df10-bfe5-11f0-befd-7d0a8fe2b6a7)

DJI's Neo 2 now offers 4K at up to 100 fps

Steve Dent for Engadget

With a new 12MP, 1/2-inch sensor camera, video quality is excellent for this price range. The Neo 2 now supports 4K at up to 60 fps or 100 fps in slo-mo mode. On the previous model, it was just 30 fps. The Neo 2 also has an f/2.0 iris to let in more light compared to the previous f/2.8. With those updates, the drone offers sharper and more color-accurate video and photos than the Neo.

There are of course some sacrifices at this price. The small sensor means the Neo 2 has mediocre low-light capability, with pronounced grain at the maximum ISO 12,800 rating that’s even noticeable at ISO 3,200. Unlike the $400 Flip, the Neo 2 has no 10-bit D-LogM capability, so over- or underexposed video is hard to correct.

With those issues, video and photos from the Neo 2 aren't quite good enough for professional work. However, it’s excellent for social media users, hobbyists and content creators, delivering smartphone-quality aerial shots.

## Wrap-up

DJI has yet to reveal availability or pricing of the Neo 2 in the US (or whether it will come here at all) due to a looming December 23 ban. If it does arrive, it will effectively have no competition at its price point, which I expect to be around $250. The HoverAir X1 is the only name brand alternative, but costs twice as much. That model offers solid follow-me capabilities for activities like biking and hiking. Feature-wise, though, it pales in comparison to the Neo 2, with inferior video quality, battery life, range and obstacle detection.

DJI’s Neo 2 is not just the best personal drone; it's the best tech product I’ve seen in a while, period. It retains everything I liked about the Neo, especially the ease of use and safety features. On top of that, it adds a host of useful functions like obstacle protection and, thank goodness, lower noise levels. With all that, the Neo 2 performs that rare trick of doing much more than I expected — for a lot less money.
