OpenAI has started selling power users extra credits for its Sora AI video generation tool. An extra 10 video gens will retail for $4 through Apple’s App Store. The company currently has a limit of 30 free gens per day, a rate that will likely decrease as OpenAI starts to monetize the offering. Bill Peebles, who heads OpenAI's Sora, [posted](https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1984011952155455596/) on X about the changes. 

"Eventually we will need to bring the free gens down to accommodate growth (we won't have enough gpus to do it otherwise!), but we’ll be transparent as it happens," he said.

Peebles also said that OpenAI plans to monetize by letting entities essentially license out their copyrighted material, either their artwork, characters or likenesses. "We imagine a world where rightsholders have the option to charge extra for cameos of beloved characters and people," he wrote. Although making the cameo feature a core part of the monetization while the company is being sued [by Cameo for trademark infringement](https://www.engadget.com/apps/openai-sued-for-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-113047158.html) is certainly a bold choice.
