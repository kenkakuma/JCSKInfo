Google has agreed to a $68 million settlement regarding claims that its voice assistant inappropriately spied on smartphone users. Plaintiffs claimed that the company’s Google Assistant platform began listening to them after it misheard conversations that sounded like its wake words. The suit argued that private information that Google Assistant shouldn't have heard was then used to deliver those individuals targeted ads. 

[_Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-settles-google-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-68-million-2026-01-26/) reported that Google denied wrongdoing in the suit, but according to court papers, the company agreed to a settlement in order to avoid the risk and costs of litigating the issue. The preliminary class action settlement was filed on Friday and now awaits approval from U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.

Google has been transitioning away from the Google Assistant platform in the past year, [replacing](https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-removing-assistant-from-most-phones-this-year-182700104.html) it with its Gemini tool. Not that AI chatbots should be [trusted](https://www.engadget.com/what-do-ai-chatbots-know-about-us-and-who-are-they-sharing-it-with-140013949.html) as paragons of privacy either.

Apple faced a very similar allegations around its Siri voice assistant in 2019; that class-action suit ended in a [$95 million](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-agrees-to-settle-a-2019-siri-privacy-lawsuit-for-95-million-195820723.html) settlement in January 2025. Not sure if a reward of [$20 per device](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/you-can-now-claim-your-piece-of-apples-95-million-siri-privacy-settlement-213020351.html) feels sufficient when these companies are accidentally overhearing deeply personal conversations and details, but that's how the justice system shakes out some times.
