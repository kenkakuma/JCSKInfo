Anime fans won't be getting any respite from the streaming service price hikes that now feel inevitable on every platform every couple of years.

That means the Fan tier will now run you $10 a month, the Mega Fan Tier is $14 a month and the Ultimate Fan Tier is $18 a month. 

The platform [introduced](https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-offline-viewing-subscription-tiers-145000647.html) its Mega Fan and Ultimate Fan options in 2020, with both at long last giving viewers an option to watch shows offline. The silver lining in today's price changes is that the Fan members are getting the same offline viewing option, although it's limited to one device. Crunchyroll is further enticing the people who might now be more interested in the Fan level by offering a discount on the annual plan for that tier; you can get a year's access for a limited time for $67.
