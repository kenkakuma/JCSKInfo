[_The Sims Mobile_](https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-the-sims-find-a-new-home-on-ios-and-android.html) is going away as EA will shut it down on January 20, nearly eight years after its debut in March 2018. An update that went live on Monday is the final one and the company is delisting the game on October 21. Since the game requires online servers (game progress is stored there), it'll no longer be possible to play _The Sims Mobile_ in three months' time.

"_The Sims Mobile_ and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination," EA said [in a blog post](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update). "You’ve amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We’re proud to have shared this journey with you, and as a token of our appreciation, we’ve prepared a few surprises as we head into _TSM_’s final chapter."

EA will run 14 events, including limited-time quests and treasure hunts, in _The Sims Mobile_ over the next few months. It's no longer possible to spend any real money in the game, though players can use their existing in-game currency. As of today, players also have unlimited energy, which "should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play," EA said. On January 6, EA will unlock all of the Build Mode and Create A Sim items so players can fully customize their homes and sims' looks for a couple of weeks before the grim reaper shows up for _The Sims Mobile._

Back in 2022, EA and Sims studio Maxis [announced Project Rene](https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-5-cross-platform-project-rene-ea-maxis-mobile-freeplay-185822870.html), a game that will run across multiple platforms, including mobile. So it's maybe not too surprising that the company wants to focus its Sims mobile efforts there.

In any case, the shutdown stinks, especially for those who have spent money on _The Sims Mobile_ as well as for the sake of [game preservation](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html). The decision to scuttle the game won't exactly [allay concerns](https://slate.com/technology/2025/10/the-sims-electronic-arts-games-jared-kushner-saudi-arabia.html) that fans of the series, which has a significant LGBTQ+ fanbase, have about the future of The Sims if and when the [planned sale of EA](https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-5-cross-platform-project-rene-ea-maxis-mobile-freeplay-185822870.html) to a group that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund goes through.
