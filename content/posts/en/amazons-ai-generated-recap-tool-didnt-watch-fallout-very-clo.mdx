Amazon's plan to offer [AI-generated recaps](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-adds-ai-generated-video-recaps-for-select-prime-video-shows-190758346.html) of Prime Video shows isn't off to a great start. The company's recap of the first season of [_Fallout_](https://www.engadget.com/the-fallout-tv-series-is-a-very-awesome-tv-show-130039789.html) features multiple errors, [_GamesRadar+_ writes](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/the-official-fallout-season-1-recap-is-filled-with-ai-and-thinks-the-show-is-set-in-the-1950s/), including basic facts about the plot of the show.

You can [watch the recap](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=317af2d4-87d3-43fd-b4f4-321618fa824b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=watch+the+recap&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3ZpZGVvL2RldGFpbC9CMEZMU1pCUlpKP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMxN2FmMmQ0LTg3ZDMtNDNmZC1iNGY0LTMyMTYxOGZhODI0YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC92aWRlby9kZXRhaWwvQjBGTFNaQlJaSiIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAAQBsb87dTDTMIGOYptyU-RpDttHwrElxqA7f1t9CkExI&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2FB0FLSZBRZJ) yourself in the "Extras" section of Amazon's _Fallout_ season two listing in Prime Video. Besides being somewhat dry, the AI-generated recap incorrectly identifies the time period of the show's Los Angeles-set flashbacks as being the 1950s, when they're actually 2077 (the Fallout franchise is set in an alternate history that diverged from our real one after 1945). [As _Gizmodo_ notes](https://gizmodo.com/fallout-ai-recap-prime-video-amazon-2000698573), the recap also seems to misunderstand the ending of the first season, which sets up season two's partnership between vault dweller Lucy and The Ghoul, an irradiated wastelander with a personal connection to the mystery at the heart of the first season.

While the recap suggests Amazon's AI system can successfully combine clips, music and dialogue into a coherent video, it apparently lacks an understanding of the details. The inaccuracies in this recap won't prevent anyone from enjoying the second season of the show, but they don't exactly inspire confidence in Amazon's tool either. It also seems like a problem that could have been easily solved by having a human employee who's watched the show review the video before it was uploaded.

Unfortunately, Amazon's lack of AI quality control extends beyond recaps of its shows and into the dubs for the shows themselves. The company pulled [AI-generated voiceover tracks](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/amazon-halts-ai-anime-dub-beta-after-widespread-ridicule-141501051.html) for _Banana Fish_ and other anime because of how bad they sounded earlier this week. It wouldn't be surprising if this recap gets pulled, corrected and re-uploaded, too. As Amazon adds more AI-generated content to its platform, users are bound to discover more ways it comes up short. The company's audience is too big, and AI is apparently still too unreliable for it to be avoided.
