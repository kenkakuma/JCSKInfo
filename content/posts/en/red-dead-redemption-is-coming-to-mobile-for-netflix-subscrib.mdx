_Red Dead Redemption_ will finally be available on mobile devices, but only for Netflix subscribers. This was discovered by [prolific news source and deals curator Wario64](https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jkjanx6k2r), who also revealed a release date of December 4. The game will be free to play on both iOS and Android devices and will include the zombie-centric DLC _Undead Nightmare_.

That same leaker has also discovered an ESRB website with ratings for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S and the Switch 2, so it's likely that Rockstar's open world western [is heading to current-gen platforms](https://www.theverge.com/news/820086/netflix-red-dead-redemption-mobile-modern-console-update). We don't have a release date for these ports. It's already available for the PS4 and the original Switch.

It's worth reiterating that this is the first _Red Dead Redemption_ from 2010, and not the sequel. It's still a great game, despite not quite reaching the highs of _Red Dead Redemption 2_.

This is just the latest team-up between Netflix and Rockstar. _Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition_ [became available on Android and iOS](https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-adding-the-gta-trilogy-to-its-games-library-on-december-14-190357966.html) for Netflix subscribers back in 2023.
