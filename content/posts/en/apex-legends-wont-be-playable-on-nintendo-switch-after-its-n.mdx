_Apex Legends_ developer Respawn said it's ending Nintendo Switch support for the game this summer, with the release of Season 30. After that point, it'll work with the Switch 2 and all other currently supported platforms, but not the original Switch. "Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch," the team wrote in a post on X.

> Hey legends, we want to share an important update about Apex Legends on the Nintendo Switch.  
>   
> Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. Future seasons of Apex Legends will continue to be available on Nintendo Switch 2.

The change will take place on August 4, 2026, so Switch players still have several months left to enjoy _Apex Legends_ on the console and make preparations for their shift to a different platform, if they plan to do so. "All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts," Respawn said. "Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026." 

The Switch 2 undoubtedly offers a better playing experience for _Apex Legends_ than the earlier model, but the news is still a blow for current Switch 1 players who didn't have plans of upgrading any time soon. _Apex Legends_ first came to Switch in 2021, two years after the game's launch on other platforms.
