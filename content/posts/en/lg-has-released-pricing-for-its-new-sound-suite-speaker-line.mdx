On Monday, we went hands-on at CES with [LG's new Sound Suite](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-sound-suite-hands-on-at-ces-2026-home-theater-powered-by-dolby-atmos-flexconnect-192709499.html) speakers featuring [Dolby Atmos FlexConnect](https://www.engadget.com/dolby-atmos-will-use-your-tv-to-expand-living-room-speaker-setups-123021095.html) and now we have pricing for the entire lineup. The modular home audio system consists of four speakers that include a soundbar, surround speakers and a subwoofer.

The centerpiece of the group is the H7 soundbar, which will retail for $1,000. The soundbar uses FlexConnect to optimize sound based on the layout of a room and its location therein. This is intended to solve for when a speaker can't be perfectly placed to deliver optimal sound, especially spatial audio.

The H7 also has a feature LG is calling Sound Follow that tracks the location of a user's phone throughout a room and adapts the audio to their location. The idea is that if you move from one side of the couch to the other, or to a chair in a totally different part of the room, you'll still receive the best possible sound.

The M7 and M5 surround speakers will sell for $400 and $250 respectively. These serve as satellite speakers to the H7 and can be placed around a room in pairs or used on their own. The W7 subwoofer carries a price tag of $600.

The entire suite is available for pre-order on LG's [US site](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=1d615601-adcc-4281-a201-ab5efe07476c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LG+Electronics&linkText=US+site&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZy5jb20vdXMvc291bmQtc3VpdGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFkNjE1NjAxLWFkY2MtNDI4MS1hMjAxLWFiNWVmZTA3NDc2YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3VzL3NvdW5kLXN1aXRlIn0&signature=AQAAAduVyJ15itMjM-eugXpka59-_VWwzESWW59HnjSuo1om&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fsound-suite) now. The site lists several packages like the "Immersive Quad Suite 7" that include the H7 soundbar and four M7 speakers. Sadly, there do not seem to be discounts for purchasing these speakers as a bundle.
