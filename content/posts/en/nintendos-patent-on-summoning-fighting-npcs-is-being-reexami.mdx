Nintendo's [lawsuit against _Palworld_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-seeks-65700-in-damages-163051523.html) just hit a snag. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has ordered a reexamination of a key Nintendo patent expected to be wielded in the case. _Games Fray_ [reports](https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/) that the office is reviewing the Switch maker's patent regarding "summon subcharacter and let it fight in 1 of 2 modes." If we view Nintendo's _Palworld_ lawsuit as a test bed for monopolizing game mechanics, the development can only be seen as a good thing. 

Several factors make the reexamination unusual. First, Nintendo's patent in question (No. 12,403,397) was just [granted](https://massivelyop.com/2025/09/10/nintendo-secures-us-patent-for-game-mechanics-that-summon-a-character-for-fights/) in September. The review was personally ordered by newly sworn-in USPTO Director John A. Squires. The Trump appointee has historically sided with patent holders, making it _harder_ to contest them. Stranger still, _Games Fray_ says this may be the USPTO's first patent reexamination in over a decade.

_Palworld_

Pocketpair

Those ingredients suggest widespread blowback may be the driving force. Although _Palworld_ developer Pocketpair is [Nintendo's immediate target](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-palworld-lawsuit-seeks-65700-in-damages-163051523.html), it's easy to see the case opening a Pandora's box where developers fear using well-established game mechanics. Indie developers would be particularly vulnerable. The "slippery slope" commentary practically writes itself.

If Nintendo's patent is ultimately invalidated, we may be able to thank Konami. A 2002 patent application from the maker of Metal Gear and Castlevania was cited as prior art, casting doubt on Nintendo's claim. A separate Nintendo patent, published in 2020, was also listed as possible prior art. [_Games Fray_'s report](https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/) dives much deeper into the legal weeds.

Nintendo now has two months to respond. During that period, third parties can come forward with additional prior art references. As a nervous industry eyes Nintendo's case as a potential test bed for monopolizing game mechanics, don't be shocked if gaming lawyers search far and wide for more examples.
