Faraway road trips just got a lot easier, at least for the passengers. [Sony Honda Mobility](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/), the joint venture between the two Japanese conglomerates created to produce electric vehicles, announced that its [Afeela EV](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobility-ces-2025-keynote-learn-more-about-the-afeela-1-ev-live-here-212536780.html) will come with PS Remote Play. While playing video games in a car may be a niche feature, it means drivers will have something to do when parked, and passengers can chip away at their favorite RPGs during long drives.

According to the announcement, the Afeela will be able to run your PS5 and PS4 consoles remotely through the infotainment system's integrated display. You can even grab your [DualSense](https://www.engadget.com/playstation-remote-play-app-android-12-ps5-dualsense-dualshock-4-145559843.html) controller from home and get right back into the game after jumping in your Afeela. Sony Honda Mobility said a 5Mbps broadband connection is required to play, and a 15Mbps rate will deliver a smoother experience.

It's not the first time we're hearing about PS Remote Play in an EV. The joint venture previously showed off the Afeela 1, which is set for its first deliveries in 2026, and its ability to remotely play PlayStation titles at [CES 2024](https://www.engadget.com/i-played-horizon-zero-dawn-inside-sony-and-hondas-afeela-concept-ev-at-ces-2024-205902922.html). As for gaming in EVs overall, Tesla famously offered Steam support for its [Model S and X](https://www.engadget.com/tesla-steam-model-s-x-054406511.html), but later removed this feature.
