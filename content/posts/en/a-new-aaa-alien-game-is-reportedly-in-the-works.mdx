If [_Alien: Romulus_](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/alien-romulus-is-a-magnificent-return-to-form-193025453.html) reawakened your appetite for the iconic [sci-fi franchise](https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-03-alien-isolation-review-escape-claws.html), the good news is that a promising video game could be on the way. According to an [_Insider Gaming_](https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-back-in-development/) report, a new game for the Alien franchise is back in development. The report's sources mentioned that the single-player game will be set in a "decaying space station" as an arcade survival horror that can be compared to "Shadow of \[the\] Tomb Raider with Xenomorphs."

It's not the first time we heard about this Alien game, which was [first reported](https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/) on in 2022 under the codename "Marathon." According to _Insider Gaming_, the game has cycled through several developers, but more recently landed with Eidos Montreal, which developed _Shadow of the Tomb Raider_ and is currently working on the upcoming [_Fable reboot_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-has-delayed-its-fable-reboot-until-2026-173118802.html). The report added that the game's development budget was increased to less than $75 million, up from the initial $30 million budget from a few years ago.

_Insider Gaming_'s report noted that the game is still in "early development," but could feature Ripley 8, the human-Xenomorph hybrid that was first seen in _Alien Resurrection._ The game's details and release date are still subject to change, but _Insider Gaming_'s sources said the game is "in a good place at this point" and is expected to release in 2028 on all platforms.
