Game publisher Paradox Interactive has [split](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/) with Colossal Order, the studio behind _Cities: Skylines II_. Colossal Order, which also made the original _Cities: Skylines_ back in 2015, will move on to something new after completing a few last updates. The intellectual property will remain with Paradox, which said today that work on _Cities: Skylines II_ will be moved to Iceflake Studios. The Finland-based internal team will be responsible for all development, including future content updates and the long-awaited console version, starting in 2026.

The move comes after about two years of trying to salvage the citybuilding sequel and the reputations of all parties. While the game was [initially](https://www.engadget.com/cities-skylines-ii-will-arrive-on-pc-and-consoles-october-24th-2023-181911885.html) expected to debut in October 2023 on PC and consoles, the launch was limited to PC, with higher minimum specs than previously announced and with a lot of bugs. The ongoing issues caused [tension and toxicity](https://www.engadget.com/whats-up-with-the-toxicity-around-cities-skylines-ii-213034938.html) between Colossal Order and the _Cities: Skylines_ audience. Although the game has reached a more stable state, new content has been [slow](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cities-skylines-ii-delays-bridges--ports-dlc-to-q4-200052345.html) to arrive and there is still no sign of a console launch as the studio exits their project.
