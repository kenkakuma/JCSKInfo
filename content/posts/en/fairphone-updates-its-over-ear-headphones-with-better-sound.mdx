Two years ago, [Fairphone](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fairphone-6-lands-a-perfect-10-for-repairability-190001687.html) launched a pair of [modular, fully-repairable headphones called the Fairbuds XL](https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-launches-a-fully-repairable-set-of-over-ear-headphones-080017046.html). Now, the Dutch social enterprise is releasing an updated version where the focus isn’t just on the quality of its hardware, but on the merits of its raw materials. 

The 2025 Fairbuds XL ship with new “premium” 40mm dynamic drivers and stronger N52 rated magnets for “more power and enhanced bass response.” Listeners should expect to hear “improved accuracy in mid and high frequencies” thanks to improved audio tuning. And there’s a new paper-based speaker membrane that’s more refined than what went before.

Sound-quality is certainly improved over the predecessor, with cleaner bass and sharper mid and high tones. You can really hear how clean the sound is, especially when you’re listening to something lush and orchestral. Going by my memory from two years ago, the ANC seems to be unchanged, able to deal with unwanted sounds like the tapping of my own keyboard with ease. 

Obviously, you shouldn’t go in expecting the same sort of brilliant sound you’d get from top tier manufacturers. Although I think Fairphone has likely closed the gap so while you’re still a generation or two behind the bleeding edge, it’s not by a shameful degree. And, if we’re honest, if you’re looking for a pair of cans that’ll last you years and years, you’re likely able to forgive the absence of the shiniest bells and whistles.

It’s easy to notice the design changes, too, with the more austere Fairphone logo and the use of solid plastic in place of the original speckled pattern. Sadly, that extends to the little pop of copper found on the four way joystick, which is now a different shade of the same colorway. I get it: A lot of people want their consumer electronics to blend in, but the loss of whimsy pains me a little. 

There’s some fairly minor but welcome quality of life improvements, including adding automatic power off after 30 minutes. Plus, buyers get the benefit of a three year warranty, and can rest assured the XL are Longtime certified. Longtime is a new European labeling standard for gear built to be long-lived, repairable and supported by a robust repair infrastructure. And, if you already own a pair of XLs, you can buy the new drivers and slot them into your existing cans.

But, in line with Fairphone’s founding principles, the update is equally focused on the raw materials that have gone into making the 2025 XLs. The PU “leather” found in the ear cushions — hardly a climate friendly material — has been ditched in favor of Bird’s Eye Fabric. That’s a cotton fabric produced with a series of air holes for breathability more commonly found in athleisure products. Similarly the PU found in the headband gets replaced with fabric that reminds me of plenty of other high end sport headphones.

Beneath the surface, the new model contains 100 percent fair mined cobalt, copper and silver — via mining credits, at least. The rare earth metals used in the speaker magnets are now 100 percent recycled, and they were assembled in a facility using 100 percent renewable energy. You’ll also find more than 90 percent recycled aluminum, and 80 percent recycled plastics, with the company pledging to recycle an equal amount of e-waste to every pair sold. Plus, as usual, Fairphone will pay the people who assemble the hardware a living wage bonus to ensure “workers can cover their family’s needs.” 

Fairbuds XL are available to order today in Europe both from the Fairphone website and select third party retailers. If you’re in the US, you’ll need to wait until “later” this month, but you’ll be able to pick them up via Amazon for $229.
