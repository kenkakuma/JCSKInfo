Lyft has officially introduced teen accounts for ages 13 to 17. This is a rideshare feature in which teenagers can request their own rides, which is similar to [Uber's pre-existing platform](https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-start-rolling-out-teen-accounts-with-safety-features-next-week-150018174.html).

Teens request the rides on their own, but parents can keep an eye on things every step of the way. Lyft says that parents or guardians can see every ride in real time and manage the account. They also get updates at pickup and drop-off and the app allows communication with the driver when needed.

This is a rideshare service for teens, so there are several new safety features. The drivers must "meet the highest standards" on the platform. Lyft says they get annual background checks and must have "proven safe driving records, positive passenger interactions and experience behind the wheel."

The teens have to enter a PIN to ensure the correct rider gets in the car, which is something Lyft has been [experimenting with for adults](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-ca/all/articles/6319159425-PIN-verification-for-riders). Audio recording of the ride is on by default, for an added layer of safety.

Lyft Teen is available right now, though not everywhere. The company has launched the platform in 200 markets, including New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and Miami, among others. It's coming to more cities as the year winds on.
