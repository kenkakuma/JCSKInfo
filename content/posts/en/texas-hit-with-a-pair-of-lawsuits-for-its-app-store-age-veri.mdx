Texas could have a serious legal battle on its hands thanks to an [age verification law](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-enacts-age-verification-law-for-app-stores-190603522.html) for app stores that it recently enacted. In response to the Texas App Store Accountability Act, the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) filed a lawsuit that argues the new order goes against First Amendment rights. The not-for-profit trade association has Amazon, [Apple](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-explains-how-it-will-comply-with-app-store-age-verification-requirements-in-texas-185934469.html) and Google amongst its members.

The law goes into effect on New Year's Day and requires app store users to verify their age before downloading apps or making in-app purchases. If underage, users have to get parental consent each time they want to download an app or make another in-app purchase. Along with those stipulations, the suit claims that there's an additional burden on developers, who have to "age-rate" their apps for different age groups.Â 

"This Texas law violates the First Amendment by restricting app stores from offering lawful content, preventing users from seeing that content, and compelling app developers to speak of their offerings in a way pleasing to the state," Stephanie Joyce, senior vice president and chief of staff for the CCIA, said in a [press release](https://ccianet.org/news/2025/10/ccia-sues-texas-to-block-unconstitutional-app-store-law/).

Along with CCIA, a student advocacy group called Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT) filed a [similar lawsuit](https://www.dwt.com/about/news/2025/10/dwt-files-1a-challenge-to-texas-app-store-law) objecting to Texas' upcoming app store requirements. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, the firm representing SEAT and the two high school students named in the lawsuit, said the law "violates the First Amendment by imposing sweeping restrictions on access to protected speech and information." The law firm also noted the potential dangers associated with collecting [personal information](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/us-employee-screening-firm-disa-hit-with-data-breach-affecting-over-33-million-people-145658681.html), like government IDs, when it comes to verifying identity.
