Many e-bike brands focus their marketing on being a sustainable and environmentally friendly consumer choice. Future Motion has gone the other direction and emphasized how its new product can pop infinite wheelies, which sounds like either loads of fun or a quick way to an injury, depending on your worldview. 

After developing a line of single-wheel skateboards called [Onewheel](https://www.engadget.com/onewheel-gt-pint-x-future-motion-180021707.html), Future Motion has released a new transportation option with an e-bike dubbed Antic. (Though I am deeply disappointed it isn't named Twowheel). The 70s-inspired design claims a top speed of 35 miles per hour, a range of 28 to 50 miles, and wide tires intended to handle many types of terrain. It also says that with its Wheelie Assist mode, the bike's gyroscopes and accelerometers can hold an endless single-wheel ride. The base model Antic has a list price of $2,500 but is currently discounted a few hundred bucks for the launch; longer-range options with more capable tires will run up to $2,900.
