Google [has filed its appeal](https://blog.google/company-news/outreach-and-initiatives/public-policy/why-were-appealing-the-doj-search-distribution-case/) to the Department of Justice’s antitrust case that ended with [a federal judge ruling](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopolist-in-search-us-judge-rules-in-antitrust-case-193358356.html) that the company was maintaining a monopoly with its search business. While the company goes through the appeals process, it’s also asking that implementation of [the remedies](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-doesnt-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-in-monopoly-case-rules-211032326.html) from the case, which include a requirement that Google share search data with its competitors, also be paused.

“As we have long said, the Court’s August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to,” Google said in a statement. “The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups. And it discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla who said they choose to feature Google because it provides the highest quality search experience for their consumers.”

The company says that the requirement that it “provide syndication services to rivals” and share search data is a privacy risk and could “discourage competitors from building their own products.” Both remedies where compromises based on what the Justice Department originally proposed, which included [forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/department-of-justice-confirms-that-it-wants-google-to-sell-off-chrome-094929822.html).

After [a 10-week trial](https://www.engadget.com/federal-judge-narrows-scope-of-antitrust-case-against-google-ahead-of-trial-202837725.html) held in 2023, Google was found to have a search monopoly in 2024 because of the placement it maintained [as the default search engine](https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html) on multiple platforms, and the control it exerted over the ads that appear in search results. Both arguments were key points in the DOJ’s [original 2020 lawsuit](https://www.engadget.com/google-us-justice-department-antitrust-competition-announcement-144344497.html).
