**Breakthrough AI Architecture Powers Performance Gains**

The M5's revolutionary architecture centers on a next-generation 10-core GPU featuring dedicated Neural Accelerators in each core, delivering up to 3.5x faster AI performance than M4 across devices. Built using third-generation 3-nanometer technology, the chip combines this AI prowess with up to 45 percent higher graphics performance and a 10-core CPU offering up to 15 percent faster multithreaded performance.​

"M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon," said Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. The chip also features an enhanced 16-core Neural Engine and a nearly 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth to 153GB/s.​

Apple showcased the M5's capabilities across demanding workflows, from AI-driven image generation in apps like Draw Things to local large language model processing. The MacBook Pro with M5 delivers up to 3.5x faster AI performance and up to 1.6x faster graphics than the previous generation.​

**Updated Pro Devices Target Creative Professionals**

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro maintains its $1,599 starting price while offering up to 24 hours of battery life and faster SSD performance for tasks like importing RAW image files. The device features the same design language with space black and silver finishes, focusing improvements on internal performance rather than aesthetic changes.​

iPad Pro models receive more substantial updates, with the 11-inch starting at $999 and 13-inch at $1,299. The tablets now include Apple's C1X cellular modem for up to 50 percent faster cellular data performance and the new N1 wireless chip enabling Wi-Fi 7 support. Updated models also feature increased memory configurations, with 256GB and 512GB models now starting with 12GB of unified memory.​

The Apple Vision Pro gains the M5 chip alongside a new Dual Knit Band for improved comfort and can render 10 percent more pixels with refresh rates up to 120Hz. The headset now supports up to two and a half hours of general use on a single charge.​

Apple's coordinated refresh demonstrates the company's continued focus on professional users seeking AI-accelerated workflows, positioning these devices as essential tools for the next generation of creative and technical applications.
