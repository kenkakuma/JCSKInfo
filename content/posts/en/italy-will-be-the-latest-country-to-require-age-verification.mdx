Later this month, Italian citizens will have one extra step to go through before getting on porn sites. On Friday, Italy's regulatory agency for communications, known as AGCOM, announced an [age verification system](https://www.agcom.it/comunicazione/avvisi/age-verification-dal-12-novembre-vigore-gli-obblighi-i-siti-e-le-piattaforme) that's meant to prevent minors from accessing websites with pornographic content. The [initial list](https://www.agcom.it/sites/default/files/provvedimenti/comunicazione/2025/Prima%20lista%20soggetti%20ex%20art.%2013_bis%20da%20pubblicare_0.pdf) of sites covers around 50 sites, including Pornhub, XHamster and OnlyFans.

The new rule will require users to get verified through "certified third parties," which could be another company, bank or mobile operator that already has the relevant info. Once the third party verifies the user's age, it will issue a code that grants access to the porn site. While the legislation's stated goal is to prevent harm to minors, the age verification process uses a "double anonymity" system to quell privacy concerns. In order to protect user privacy, porn sites can only see if a user is of age and not their identity, while the third-party verifier can only see the user's identity and not the website they're trying to get on.

According to the legislation, users have to do this each time they try to get on affected porn sites. [AGCOM](https://www.agcom.it/comunicazione/avvisi/age-verification-dal-12-novembre-vigore-gli-obblighi-i-siti-e-le-piattaforme) said the new rule goes into effect on November 12, and any porn sites that are found non-compliant could be hit with penalties of up to 250,000 euros.Â 

Italy is the latest in the European Union to implement age verification rules, after France put a [similar system](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yelvlnzveo) into place in the summer. Just outside the EU, the UK also recently introduced its own [age verification process](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/people-in-the-uk-now-have-to-take-an-age-verification-selfie-to-watch-porn-online-164418948.html) that requires either a selfie or government ID. Since then, Pornhub said that UK visitors to its site have plummeted [77 percent](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkz3m3re1zo).
