Close enough, welcome back [Xperia Play](https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-28-sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review.html). After releasing a [teaser video](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ayaneos-first-smartphone-could-have-physical-shoulder-buttons-182033773.html) in early November, Ayaneo fully revealed its first smartphone called the [Pocket Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVDNGMIlzmI). As suspected, the Ayaneo Pocket Play features a sliding mechanism that transforms it from a chunky smartphone into a gaming handheld.

In its gaming configuration, the Pocket Play features a controller setup with a D-pad, ABXY buttons and four shoulder buttons. However, Ayaneo has modernized the Xperia Play design by incorporating two touchpads, which will also be seen in the handheld maker's next flagship device called the [Next II](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ayaneo-next-ii-is-a-hulking-gaming-handheld-with-a-9-inch-display-175018940.html). According to Ayaneo, you can map these touchpads as virtual joysticks or customizable inputs. Ayaneo hasn't revealed the specs of the Pocket Play yet, but the device appears to have slots that could hint at expandable storage options.

The Pocket Play will be Ayaneo's first foray into the smartphone world, albeit with mobile gaming in mind. It'll have to compete against the likes of other gaming-specific smartphones like the Redmagic 10 Pro or the Asus [ROG Phone series](https://www.engadget.com/the-new-rog-phone-8-from-asus-finally-puts-a-good-camera-in-a-gaming-phone-002618805.html), as well as the latest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones that can also handle demanding mobile games. Ayaneo will launch the Pocket Play on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ayaneo-offical/ayaneo-pocket-play-mobile-phone-and-gaming-handheld-in-one) soon, but hasn't revealed any pricing details yet.
