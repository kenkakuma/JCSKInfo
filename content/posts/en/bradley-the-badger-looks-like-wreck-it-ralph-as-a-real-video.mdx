A lot of trailers drop during The Game Awards, but the comedy of _Bradley the Badger_ stood out from the pack. The conceit is similar to _Wreck-It Ralph_. Bradley, the protagonist of a fictional platforming series, is suddenly transported into the worlds of other unfinished video games; the trailer shows a badger-ified _Bloodborne_, _Cyberpunk 2077_ and _The Last of Us_. He also has access to a kit of dev tools that let him modify these incomplete projects, getting a taste of making a game. As the trailer ends, Bradley briefly crosses into the real world and comes face to face with an actual game developer. This looks like it will be a funny and very meta game. _Astro Bot_ made that combo work brilliantly, so here's hoping _Bradley the Badger_ does too. 

"_Bradley_ is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them," said Christian Cantamessa, co-founder of Day 4 Night Studios. "Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them." Cantamessa and fellow co-founder Davide Soliani have some big credits on their resumes, including _Red Dead Redemption_, _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_ and _Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle_. The titular badger is voiced by Evan Peters, who has been in the recent X-Men movies as well as _Tron: Ares_.

The team is planning to release the game on Steam, with consoles possibly to follow, but no timeline has been given yet.
