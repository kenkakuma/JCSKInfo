One does not simply spend more than 11 hours watching [The Lord of the Rings trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZbG3_mYEn4) in a single weekend at home when the opportunity to do so in theaters arises. As _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_ turns 25, Fathom Entertainment and Warner Bros. announced theatrical screenings of the Peter Jackson trilogy in their extended editions, according to an exclusive report from [_Variety_](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/lord-of-the-rings-extended-editions-return-to-theaters-1236600677/).

The re-releases will be available in DBOX presentations from January 16 to 19, complete with movements and vibrations to make you feel like you're making the journey to Mordor with Frodo and his entourage. If you prefer a traditional experience, the trilogy will be available in standard format from January 23 to 25.
