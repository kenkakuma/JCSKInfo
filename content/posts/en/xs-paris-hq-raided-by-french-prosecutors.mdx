Paris prosecutors [announced](https://x.com/parquetdeParis/status/2018608559144198510) that a search was underway at offices belong to Elon Musk’s X platform as part of an ongoing investigation first launched in [January 2025](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/02/07/paris-prosecutors-open-investigation-into-x-s-algorithms_6737910_13.html). The raid is being conducted by Paris and national cybercrime units, with support from Interpol, according to post from Paris prosecutors on X. Officials from X have yet to comment on the matter.

At the same time, Paris prosecutors issued summonses to Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino for “voluntary interviews” on April 20, 2026 in Paris. The prosecutors also announced they would no longer use X and would only communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram going forward.

The searches are part of an investigation that has been ongoing for nearly a year over the functioning of X’s algorithms that are “likely to have distorted the operation of an automated data processing system,” investigators [said at the time.](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/02/07/paris-prosecutors-open-investigation-into-x-s-algorithms_6737910_13.html) Those changes reportedly gave greater prominence to certain political content (especially from Musk) without user knowledge — something that could be a crime under French laws.

An investigation was [officially launched in July](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/france-launches-criminal-probe-of-xs-alleged-algorithm-manipulation-123017920.html), with Paris prosecutors adding an additional charge: “Fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system by an organized group.” More recently, it also includes “complicity in the possession of images of minors representing a pedo-pornographic character,” due to images created by Grok between December 25, 2025 and January 1, 2026.

In July, X said in a statement that the probe “egregiously undermines X’s fundamental right to due process and threatens our users' rights to privacy and free speech. \[French officials have\] accused X of manipulating its algorithm for 'foreign interference' purposes, an allegation which is completely false.”
