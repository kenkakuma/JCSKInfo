**Massive Performance Gains Target Creative Professionals**

The M5 chip represents Apple's most ambitious tablet processor to date, offering up to 3.5 times faster AI performance compared to the M4 model and 5.6 times faster than the M1 version. The chip features a 10-core GPU with Neural Accelerator technology in each core, specifically designed to handle demanding creative workflows and on-device AI tasks.​

According to Apple's benchmarks, the new iPad Pro delivers up to 6.7 times faster 3D rendering in Octane X compared to M1 models, while video transcoding in Final Cut Pro sees a six-fold improvement. For AI-specific tasks, image generation in Draw Things performs four times faster than M1 models, positioning the device as a powerhouse for creative professionals.

**Enhanced Connectivity and Memory Upgrades**

Beyond raw processing power, Apple introduced significant connectivity improvements with custom-designed C1X and N1 chips. The C1X cellular modem delivers up to 50% faster mobile data performance while consuming 30% less power than the previous generation. The N1 wireless chip enables Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support, enhancing features like AirDrop and Personal Hotspot.​

Memory enhancements include a nearly 30% increase in unified memory bandwidth to over 150GB/s, while the base 256GB and 512GB models now start with 12GB of RAM—a 50% increase from previous models. Storage performance also sees up to 2x faster read and write speeds.​

**Familiar Design with Premium Display**

The new iPad Pro retains the ultra-thin design language of its predecessor, measuring just 5.3mm for the 11-inch model and 5.1mm for the 13-inch version. Both feature the acclaimed Ultra Retina XDR display with tandem OLED technology, supporting up to 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content.​

Pricing remains unchanged from the M4 generation, with the 11-inch model starting at $999 and the 13-inch version at $1,299. The announcement comes alongside refreshed MacBook Pro and Vision Pro models, all powered by the M5 chip, demonstrating Apple's commitment to unified silicon across its premium product lines.​

The iPad Pro M5 ships with iPadOS 26, featuring enhanced multitasking capabilities and Apple Intelligence integration designed to take full advantage of the new processor's AI capabilities.​
