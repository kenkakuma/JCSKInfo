SpaceX will reportedly receive a $2 billion contract to develop satellites for the US government, according to the [_Wall Street Journal_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a0053e86-fa18-44a9-a2a2-7c639f9bccdb&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&linkText=Wall+Street+Journal&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2ouY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL25hdGlvbmFsLXNlY3VyaXR5L2Vsb24tbXVza3Mtc3BhY2V4LXNldC10by13aW4tMi1iaWxsaW9uLXBlbnRhZ29uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1kZWFsLWMwYTUxMzI1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMDA1M2U4Ni1mYTE4LTQ0YTktYTJhMi03YzYzOWY5YmNjZGIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzai5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtc2VjdXJpdHkvZWxvbi1tdXNrcy1zcGFjZXgtc2V0LXRvLXdpbi0yLWJpbGxpb24tcGVudGFnb24tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWRlYWwtYzBhNTEzMjUifQ&signature=AQAAARm6wyYiD2RdWn4G0ogTXoKwqiEy_dc5GOIEmoLlrxhe&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Fpolitics%2Fnational-security%2Felon-musks-spacex-set-to-win-2-billion-pentagon-satellite-deal-c0a51325). The _WSJ_'s report detailed that SpaceX will be tasked with developing up to 600 satellites that can track missiles and aircraft and will be used for President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" project.

[Announced back](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-trump-announces-the-golden-dome-missile-defense-system/) in May, the president introduced a project to build an anti-missile defense system that would intercept missile attacks before reaching their target. The Golden Dome is reminiscent of Israel's [Iron Dome](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a0053e86-fa18-44a9-a2a2-7c639f9bccdb&featureId=text-link&merchantName=CNBC&linkText=Iron+Dome&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA2LzEzL2lzcmFlbC1pcm9uLWRvbWUuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTAwNTNlODYtZmExOC00NGE5LWEyYTItN2M2MzlmOWJjY2RiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA2LzEzL2lzcmFlbC1pcm9uLWRvbWUuaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAAT143CXBRCalaY3kXK1nt9cv1c_3D3SJmm63WndluX5N&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2025%2F06%2F13%2Fisrael-iron-dome.html) system, but the Pentagon has yet to reveal concrete details about the project. Considering the scale of the project, it's worth noting that SpaceX's reported $2 billion contract could be one of many associated with the Golden Dome. According to the report, companies like Anduril Industries and Palantir Technologies could also be involved with the development, which the Trump administration wants to complete before the end of his presidential term.

Beyond the Golden Dome, the _WSJ_ reported that the Pentagon is planning to use SpaceX's extensive satellite network for other purposes, including military communications and vehicle tracking. While the numbers are [constantly fluctuating](https://www.engadget.com/spacex-loses-40-starlink-satellites-geomagnetic-storm-112059901.html), SpaceX currently has more than 8,000 satellites for its Starlink service.
