It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/) is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. 

Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some [weird tech](https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html).

You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either. Some are [available to buy right now.](https://www.engadget.com/17-ces-gadgets-you-can-buy-right-now-164325644.html)

You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We also had [CES live updates](https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html) with all the latest news from the event. Be sure to check out [Engadget’s best of CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html) as well, in which we highlight 15 winners across several categories, and name our best in show award winner.

## Lego

![Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SMARTBrick_16x9.jpg)

Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.

Lego

In its [first CES appearance](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/follow-the-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-right-here-130005940.html), Lego announced the [Smart Brick](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html), a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.

Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components.

The first “[Smart Play](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=Smart+Play&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play)” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and _The Imperial March_.

Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to [check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000436.html) and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.

All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.

## LG

![LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg)

LG's CLOiD robot.

LG

Along with some TVs (which we’ll get to momentarily), LG brought plenty of other products to CES. For one thing, the company shone the spotlight on its [CLOiD robot.](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-reveals-its-laundry-folding-robot-at-ces-2026-215121021.html) Like the far creepier-looking [1X Neo](https://www.engadget.com/ai/1x-neo-is-a-20000-home-robot-that-will-learn-chores-via-teleoperation-040252200.html), the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food.

This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon. During an in-person CES demo, Engadget senior reporter Karissa Bell saw CLOiD competently pull off some household tasks, [albeit very slowly](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html).

The company also debuted the [LG Sound Suite](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html), a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of [xboom speakers](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html) as well as some [monitors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html) and [ultralight Gram laptops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lgs-aerominum-gram-pro-laptops-feel-impossibly-light-and-strong-200317743.html) that are made with a material it's calling [Aerominum](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html). 

## The chipmakers

![NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jensen-huang.gif)

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.

NVIDIA

It's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means [NVIDIA](https://www.engadget.com/computing/watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-keynote-with-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here-ai-robotics-updates-and-more-130028170.html), [Intel](https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-core-ultra-series-3-panther-lake-launch-event-130040881.html), [AMD](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-ceo-lisa-sus-keynote-presentation-190012370.html) and Qualcomm are all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.

Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was laregly a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have [some news to share](https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html).

NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios. The company also revealed that a super computer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture NVIDIA unveiled in 2024 is in production.

![As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/1833e610-ea90-11f0-bfbe-ac3772d5afe3)

As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.

Sam Chapman for Engadget

Things haven’t exactly been going great for Intel for a while, but the company is surely hoping that its [Core Ultra Series 3 chips](https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html) can help it right the ship. These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops.

The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.

Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some _Battlefield 6_ on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and [came away impressed](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html). The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.

![A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/8b508280-eaa8-11f0-bffb-7903d4a9ed90)

A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.

AMD

Of course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several [CPUs](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-new-ryzen-ai-max-chips-and-ryzen-7-9850x3d-court-desktop-enthusiasts-at-ces-2026-033000587.html) for [laptops and desktops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html), while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.”

![Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation &quot;X2.&quot;](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HERO_Image_Snapdragon_X2_Plus.png)

Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation &quot;X2.&quot;

Qualcomm

And then there’s [Qualcomm](https://www.engadget.com/computing/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x2-plus-chip-at-ces-170000392.html). The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. It’s more of a mid-range chip that isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the last generation.

## Laptops

![Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9e798a0-ea85-11f0-bbd1-8dfc40a2d49e)

Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on

Mat Smith for Engadget

What would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our [dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/all-the-laptops-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2026-160610752.html) at this year’s show.)

Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read [our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html) for the specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.

Dell realized it [messed up](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html) by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. [A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html), including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.

![On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg)

On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.

We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint by bringing the [ROG Zephyrus Duo](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html) to CES. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.

![Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tablet](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/asus_1.jpg)

Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tablet

ASUS

That’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The [ROG Flow Z13-KJP](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-asus-made-a-special-hideo-kojima-version-of-the-rog-flow-z13-000000768.html) has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.

## Micro RGB TVs 

![Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg)

Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV.

Devindra Hardawar for Engadget

As eve, TVs were [front and center at CES,](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html) Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually.

However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. [Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html) for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.

We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a [mammoth 130-inch concept model](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html) that [Samsung brought to Las Vegas](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html). The company [unveiled](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html) its first Micro RGB TV in August, — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.

LG revealed its first [Micro RGB set](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html) at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG [showed off its latest Wallpaper TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html), which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's [new Gallery TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html) — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.

## Other new TVs and OS updates

![Ember Artline TV.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/877150a0-e683-11f0-82fe-0fd2cae385ac)

Ember Artline TV.

Amazon

We’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that scene with the [Ember Artline TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ember-artline-is-amazons-answer-to-samsungs-the-frame-150015104.html). The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room.

It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.

![The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/New-Fire-TV-UI.jpg)

The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.

Amazon

Speaking of Fire TV, Amazon has [revamped the platform’s user interface](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/amazon-is-redesigning-its-fire-tv-ui-for-streaming-sticks-and-tvs-150000622.html) with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the Fire TV OS will deliver speed boosts of up to 20 to 30 percent. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.

On the Google side of TV land, you can expect [more Gemini-powered features](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html). The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s [hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tvs-new-gemini-features-range-from-useful-to-unnecessary-222900001.html).

Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have [expanded](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/peacock-is-expanding-dolby-vision-and-atmos-availability-for-live-sports-023000794.html) their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s _Sunday Night Football_ streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to _Sunday Night Football_ on Peacock too.

Belkin, meanwhile, has a [new wireless HDMI dongle](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/belkin-announces-a-wireless-hdmi-dongle-that-doesnt-need-wi-fi-access-215513179.html) that doesn't require a Wi-Fi connection. That should make it easy to beam videos from a device with a USB-C port to a TV, monitor or projector — handy if you’re planning an outdoor movie night in a space with spotty internet access.

## Monitors and projectors

![undefined](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/0f0df4c0-df61-11f0-9cf8-f4ad7e2cbdde)

Let's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the [monitors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-gaming-monitors-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2026-130000433.html) and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a [52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor](https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-unveils-a-massive-52-inch-6k-ultrawide-monitor-at-ces-2026-140024029.html) (the first of those on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and give each a dedicated section of the display — that could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that set up. It's possible to control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.

Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.

[Samsung](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html) and [LG](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html) revealed some new gaming monitors ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES , though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the [27-inch UltraGear GX7,](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lgs-ultragear-gx7-is-its-fastest-and-brightest-oled-gaming-monitor-to-date-160059443.html) a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.

Samsung brought the latest version of its [FreeStyle+ projector](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html) to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith [checked out the new model](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html) in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.

Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore [announced the Nebula P1i](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/soundcores-nebula-p1i-portable-projector-launches-in-early-2026-for-369-160020321.html), a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for camping trips too, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.

XGIMI was [also at CES](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xgimis-titan-noir-max-4k-projector-has-a-dynamic-iris-for-increased-contrast-170044625.html) to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.

Samsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.

Billy Steele for Engadget

Samsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the leadup to the event, it announced its [two new soundbars](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html) (we're had some hands-on time [with one of those](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html)) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've [got some IRL impressions of those](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html)). It also announced plans to [bring Google Photos to TVs](https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html).

At the [First Look showcase](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-the-biggest-announcements-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059466.html) on Sunday, Samsung talked up "AI experiences everywhere. For everyone" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. 

First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.

Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.

## L'Oreal

A pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.

L'Oréal

L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a [trio of gadgets](https://www.engadget.com/science/loreals-ces-2026-beauty-devices-include-a-skin-like-flexible-led-mask-070000576.html). The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.

The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's only in prototype form for now and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. 

The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It's said to have sensors that employ "built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning" so they can adapt to your gestures and "maximize individual experience." L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation "effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F." You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.

## Mobile

![Samsung 三摺疊 Galaxy Z TriFold 登場：12.9mm 厚 G 型結構有別華為、10 吋 120Hz、5,600mAh 電池](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f138bf10-eaba-11f0-aff7-fd1639788e13)

Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold

Engadget

At CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company [officially announced last month](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-fully-unveils-its-galaxy-z-trifold-phone-and-itll-be-available-in-korea-in-a-few-days-010000499.html). Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea) and bulkiness.

However, after Sam opened it up, “my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate could come in very useful for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read [Sam’s hands-on for his full initial impressions](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html).

![undefined](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/4b11b870-e5b1-11f0-aad7-f41cc5c812e6)

Almost exactly three decades after releasing its [first proper clamshell flip phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTAC), Motorola [revealed](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/motorola-just-announced-a-foldable-phone-to-rival-samsung-and-google-at-ces-010015323.html) its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll get the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.

Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a [physical keyboard phone accessory](https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html) from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can [reserve one now](https://www.clicksphone.com/communicator) for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.

As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150 mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can [lock in a pre-order](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html) for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.

The Punkt MC03 phone.

Punkt

Those who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The [MC03](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/minimal-phone-pioneer-punkt-is-back-with-a-new-privacy-focused-model-at-ces-110000705.html) is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app.

The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then it's a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).

## Charging tech

![undefined](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/24641140-db80-11f0-b7d7-4b9d7391fd44)

Anker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a [refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-the-switch-2-ces-2026-screen-for-checking-battery-life-170029146.html) that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on.

Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and it will ship later this year.

![Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/10768a50-ea76-11f0-bfd3-1e4dbcb777e3)

Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)

Anker

Anker [unveiled](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-unveils-a-new-lineup-of-chargers-and-docks-at-ces-2026-160021195.html) its neat Nano Charger, which can seemingly identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40.

The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March.

There’s also a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!

## AI 

![Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/59c6e9b0-e8dd-11f0-9d2e-c8c0e25cec4a)

Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.

Amazon

No prizes for guessing that there was a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's [rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-rolling-out-alexa-for-the-web-so-you-can-use-its-assistant-without-a-dedicated-device-150053826.html). That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.

Karissa Bell for Engadget

There were a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The [Sweekar](https://www.engadget.com/ai/sweekar-turns-the-tamagotchi-into-a-physical-ai-pocket-pet-that-wont-die-on-you-023525228.html) will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it "returns." Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the  Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.

Ludens AI, meanwhile, [showed off](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/japanese-startup-ludens-ai-brought-two-very-adorable-robots-to-ces-2026-021914130.html) a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch.

Amy Skorheim for Engadget

We also saw the [Fraimic](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/fraimic-is-an-e-ink-display-that-turns-your-ideas-into-ai-art-120000454.html), an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic (which costs $399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping in this spring.

![MindClip held in a hand.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/switchbotmindclip.jpg)

MindClip held in a hand.

Daniel Cooper for Engadget

Some companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the [AI MindClip](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/switchbot-turned-up-to-ces-with-an-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say-014959824.html), which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its [Work voice recorder](https://www.engadget.com/ai/ankers-soundcore-work-ai-voice-recorder-offers-transcription-in-an-ultra-compact-form-factor-160030844.html).

Plaid, meanwhile, brought its [NotePin follow up](https://www.engadget.com/ai/watch-out-theres-a-new-ai-pin-in-town-that-can-transcribe-all-your-conversations-153131281.html) to the dance. This time around, the [NotePin S](https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html) has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing.

![Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle app](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/VoicebudsWithApp1.jpg)

Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle app

Subtle

As for [Subtle’s Voicebuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-subtle-voicebuds-use-ai-to-transcribe-your-words-below-a-whisper-or-in-very-loud-spaces-like-the-ces-show-floor-000000019.html), those are said to be capable of picking up audio below the sound of a whisper, so you can very quietly dictate information to them and an AI model will transcribe what you can say. You can use the $199 voicebuds as regular earbuds too for making calls and listening to audio.

However, you’ll need to fork over $17 a month for access to features like instant dictation and the option to to transcribe notes without having to look at your phone (internet access is required to use Subtle’s best transcription models too). If you opt not to subscribe, the Voicebuds will use a smaller local model for transcription.

On a similar note, Bee [provided an update](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/bee-has-been-busy-since-its-acquisition-by-amazon-last-year-150025311.html) on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon [bought the company](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-acquiring-an-ai-wearable-that-listens-to-everything-you-do-221103233.html) last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that draft an email when you say you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.

## Robots

The product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.

Boston Dynamics

Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s [latest model](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-announces-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047772.html) is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. 

Per a [press release](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/), the partnership "will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry." As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.

![Switchbot&#39;s Onero H1.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/switchbot_onero_.jpg)

Switchbot's Onero H1.

Karissa Bell for Engadget

LG’s CLOiD is still a concept helper robot for now, but the Onero H1 is one you may be able to buy as soon as this year. During [an in-person demo](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html), we saw Switchbot’s Onero H1 robot (slowly) pick up clothes, chuck them in a washing machine and close the door. The company has also released a video that shows the Onero H1 carrying out other household tasks, from serving food and drinks to washing windows. We’re told Switchbot plans to sell the robot for "less than $10,000."

![Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg)

Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.

Then there’s [OlloBot](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html), a companion robot with an optional extendable, fuzzy neck that’s warm to the touch. OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break.

The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too.

The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit. How adorable!

Sony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026

Afeela

Sony and Honda brought the [latest revision of their first Afeela EV](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-honda-mobilitys-afeela-prototype-2026-puts-an-suv-spin-on-its-too-familiar-sedan-at-ces-043927882.html) to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to [play your PS5 remotely](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-first-ev-with-honda-will-let-you-remotely-play-ps5-in-your-car-202359091.html) while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates.

Sony Honda Mobility plans to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona. However, after getting a close-up look at the latest iteration of the EV, Engadget contributor Tim Stevens reckons the Afeela 1 [feels “](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/at-ces-2026-sony-honda-mobilitys-latest-afeela-1-still-feels-woefully-out-of-date-163513001.html)[more and more out of touch](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/at-ces-2026-sony-honda-mobilitys-latest-afeela-1-still-feels-woefully-out-of-date-163513001.html)” with each passing year, even though it “was an audacious product when it was [announced at CES 2020.”](https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-sony-vision-s.html)

We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.

![Longbow Motors Speedster](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CES_2026_Donut_Watt_Longbow_003.jpg)

Longbow Motors Speedster

Tim Stevens for Engadget

Longbow Motors [announced](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ces-2026-longbow-motors-shows-off-its-speedster-ev-with-donut-labs-in-wheel-motors-192329111.html) a pair of lightweight EVs that have a curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. The Speedster and Roadster boast advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs, a Verge Motorcycles spinoff. Longbow brought the Speedster to CES and the EV looks quite fetching.

The vehicles will be pricey, though. Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, but that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.

![Muxi](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg)

Muxi

Segway

Segway is [expanding](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html) its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi (above) looks quite pretty and has a cup holder(!), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.

Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.

## Gaming 

![Slide from NVIDIA&#39;s CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NVIDIA_DLSS_4.5.jpg)

Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5

NVIDIA

NVIDIA [announced](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html) the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.

On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.

NVIDIA also [detailed](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html) a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250 Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled.

You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur.

It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.

8BitDo FlipPad

8BitDo

The [FlipPad](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdo-is-unveiling-a-new-mobile-gaming-pad-at-ces-134555603.html) is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of [neat physical controllers for phones](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html) that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. And that’s not to mention emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. The company also [unveiled a new Xbox controller](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-ultimate-3e-gamepad-for-xbox-offers-swappable-button-modules-and-joysticks-160011248.html) with swappable joysticks and button modules.

![A keyboard thing.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/b74397b0-eb1b-11f0-abef-b2b29df4e2be)

A keyboard thing.

Corsair

Why have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair [slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/corsair-made-a-keyboard-with-a-built-in-stream-deck-163158296.html) and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller and since I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.

It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that _Helldivers 2_ profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. They can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.

GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The [Swift Drive](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-game-controller-has-a-force-feedback-steering-wheel-lodged-in-the-middle-034521141.html) (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year.

In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make [a modular controller](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyperkin-and-gamesir-x5-alteron-modular-game-controller-ces-2026-221853624.html) that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.

Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a [SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-reveals-a-steamos-variant-of-the-legion-go-2-at-ces-010000852.html). That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199.

Razer had some concept gear to show off, including [an AI-driven headset](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-motoko-is-a-concept-gaming-headset-that-doubles-as-an-ai-wearable-140000534.html) with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a [gaming chair](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-madison-concept-chair-has-reactive-lighting-immersive-audio-and-multi-zone-haptics-140000118.html) with haptic feedback and spatial audio built in. There’s also an [AI desktop companion device](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html) with several avatars to choose from, including an anime girl and legendary _League of Legends_ player Faker.

## Audio

![A speaker and a turntable.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/a76cdb40-df67-11f0-bbef-7a7c8f195e41)

A speaker and a turntable.

Victrola

Victrola [announced](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/this-speaker-by-victrola-sits-underneath-turntables-and-streams-audio-via-bluetooth-100021991.html) a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while thanks to its Sonos integration, and the Soundstage speaker is tempting too. The Soundstage will be available this summer for $350.

![The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Cambridge_Speakers_LRSeries_Green_Front_LineUp.jpg)

The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.

Cambridge Audio

Speaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these [three wireless bookshelf options](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/cambridge-audio-unveils-three-wireless-bookshelf-speakers-at-ces-100000178.html) from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer hut no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though).

At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model and the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.

There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victorla and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of [earbuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-just-announced-a-bunch-of-new-earbuds-at-ces-130044239.html) and [gaming headsets](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jbl-launches-a-trio-of-gaming-headsets-for-ces-130000929.html). Shure now has a [USB-C version](https://www.engadget.com/audio/shure-debuts-a-usb-c-version-of-its-mv88-microphone-at-ces-2026-010000294.html) of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they [still cost $40](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/jlab-adds-anc-to-its-tiny-wireless-earbuds-for-ces-2026-160000342.html).

![PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF8959.jpg)

PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.

Nathan Ingraham for Engadget

PartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.

Anker, meanwhile, has new [AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ankers-new-aerofit-2-earbuds-can-switch-between-open-ear-and-anc-form-factors-160014977.html) that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March.

Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including [Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ces-2026-shokz-new-earbuds-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-080000996.html) — which have Dolby Atmos support — and [Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers](https://www.engadget.com/audio/hands-on-with-fender-audios-headphones-and-speakers-at-ces-2026-203104561.html).

Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the exterior of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now, but the audio quality is “excellent,” Billy wrote in [his hands-on story](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/klipsch-atlas-hp-1-hands-on-a-return-to-hi-fi-headphones-at-ces-2026-130000415.html).

## Smart home

![Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/bcb64fa0-ebc3-11f0-bfb5-76c00759b395)

Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum

Engadget

As ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a [robot vacuum concept from Dreame](https://www.engadget.com/home/dreames-latest-robot-vacuum-concept-has-slightly-terrifying-legs-that-can-climb-full-size-stairs-210000399.html). It's one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high.

While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.

[Narwhal](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html) built a vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a "PetCare Mode" you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you're not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both products should be available in the spring.

Anker's Eufy brand has [a new robot vacuum too](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ankers-ces-smart-home-lineup-includes-a-1600-eufy-robovac-160000133.html), along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. This one’s pretty interesting: Lockin’s latest [vein-recognition smart lock](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lockins-everlasting-vein-recognizing-smart-lock-doorbell-cam-combo-is-peak-ces-013431113.html) can wirelessly recharge via an optical infrared beam emitted by a separate device that’s plugged into an outlet.

On a similar note, Ring has [updated](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-relaunches-its-suite-of-smart-home-sensors-140000667.html) its door, window and break glass sensors, and it has introduced an OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. Most of those will be available in March, though can pre-order the car alarm now.

Elsewhere in home security, Ugreen [announced a modular system](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ugreen-launches-a-smart-home-security-platform-at-ces-130000389.html) that does not require a subscription. At a time when so many companies are desperate to sell you a subscription for dependable monthly revenue, that’s quite refreshing. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.

IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim [checked out the products](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ikeas-first-ces-appearance-included-a-6-matter-smart-bulb-172623474.html) and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA's lamps and other devices.

Amy also went hands-on with some [pretty interesting devices from Emerson Smart](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/emerson-smart-brings-offline-voice-control-to-lamps-and-fans-201500078.html). The company’s on-device voice command tech means that you can control its smart plugs, fans, heaters and air fryers without a Wi-Fi connection or having to set things up through an app.

![Philips Hue SpatialAware feature](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f327a7d0-ebac-11f0-9bfd-2f45a278fd90)

Philips Hue SpatialAware feature

Speaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES. You'll need a Hue Bridge Pro to use the [SpatialAware feature](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/philips-hue-spatialaware-feature-harmonizes-all-the-lights-in-a-room-101843600.html), which uses augmented reality to make sure all of the lights in a room are working together harmoniously to create, for instance, a more natural-looking sunset scene. Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring. Also on the way is Apple Home support for the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors.

Elsewhere in lighting, Govee has a new floor lamp, as well as a ceiling light that's said to [simulate a skylight](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/govees-ces-lineup-includes-a-ceiling-lamp-that-simulates-skylights-130000611.html).

In terms of kitchen tech, GE Appliances has a [new smart refrigerator](https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ge-appliances-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326073.html) that's designed to make restocking easier. It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It's possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There's also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge's crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899. Check out Amy Skorheim’s [hands-on story](https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/the-ge-profile-smart-fridge-stops-you-from-buying-too-much-kale-172433059.html) for our initial impressions.

![Nosh](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/noshlee.jpg)

Nosh

Daniel Cooper for Engadget

[Nosh](https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/nosh-is-an-ai-cooking-robot-for-the-meal-prep-crowd-170000610.html), meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you'll be able to buy in the next few months. Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh's repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you'll still need to prep the fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you're ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.

Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the [T1 leaf blower](https://www.engadget.com/home/ces-2026-the-tone-outdoors-t1-solved-the-biggest-problem-with-leaf-blowers-234309500.html) (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September. Meanwhile, Segway’s Navimow unit has a bunch of [new robot mowers](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/segways-navimow-brand-unveiled-a-new-line-of-robotic-lawn-mowers-at-ces-2026-130007014.html).

## Health and accessibility

![Image of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/thronelede.jpg)

Image of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.

Daniel Cooper for Engadget

It perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that a toilet computer made an appearance in our roundup of [weird CES tech](https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html). But if I’ve learned anything from watching [_Scrubs_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsVgi8hoFFc), it’s that our waste offers up a lot of revealing information about our health, so [Throne](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html) is a pretty compelling device.

It has a camera and microphone to track your bowel motions and urination levels. The idea is to figure out your regular toilet usage and then flag any deviations from that. The creators hope that Throne will help you gain a better understanding of your gut health, which could be beneficial for those on GLP-1 drugs, for instance. Throne will start shipping in February for $340 and a $6 per month subscription.

![Image of Vivoo's FlowPad](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/vivooflowpad.png)

Image of Vivoo's FlowPad

Vivoo

Vivoo also showed off a toilet device that can monitor your urination levels. Not only that, the company unveiled [a smart menstrual pad](https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-weve-seen-at-ces-2026-so-far-134056504.html). The idea is for for wearers to scan the pad with their phone camera after use.

Elsewhere, the [latest version](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/withings-updated-body-scan-scale-tracks-60-different-biomarkers-010000703.html) of Withing’s Body Scan scale can track 60 biomarkers, up from the 40 that the [first model from 2023](https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-scan-connected-health-station-is-amazing-if-inessential-140001021.html) can keep tabs on. The Body Scan 2 should be available in the spring for $600.

One other health-focused product we found interesting was the [Eyebot vision test booth](https://www.engadget.com/general/eyebot-promises-an-accurate-vision-test-in-a-couple-of-minutes-160000184.html). This kiosk aims to speed up the eye exam process with a test that takes just a couple of minutes. A licensed eye doctor who works remotely will take a look at Eyebot’s findings before signing off on a prescription.

The kiosk can’t run medical tests, such as the short blast of air that eye doctors use to assess the risk of glaucoma. But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.

A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the ground

Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget

Accessibility tech is a welcome sight at CES, and [WheelMove](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/wheelmove-gives-manual-wheelchairs-the-power-and-height-to-handle-rough-terrain-143000560.html) looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users. It’s a device with a large front wheel that can quickly be attached to any manual wheelchair. It can then raise the wheelchair’s smaller front wheels off the ground, primarily to help users navigate rough terrain. The $6,000 WheelMove will debut in France later their year before a broader rollout.

ReviMo has built a robotic lift that it says can help people move themselves from (for instance) a bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a caregiver. The company expects [Niko](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/niko-is-a-robotic-lift-for-people-with-limited-mobility-that-doesnt-require-a-caregivers-help-184500703.html) to cost around $15,000, but it’s attempting to get the device covered by insurance.

![Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as "bionic footwear."](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dephy_shoes_white_pair.jpg)

Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as "bionic footwear."

Karissa Bell for Engadget

Dephy’s [Sidekick](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/these-robotic-sneakers-gave-me-a-surprising-boost-at-ces-174500005.html) is designed as a walking aid. It’s an ankle-worn exoskeleton that’s attached to a sneaker. The Sidekick has sensors that can detect the user’s gait and adapt to it in order to deliver an effective boost in each step.

At $4,500, the Sidekick isn’t cheap, but it could be a boon for those who are perhaps not as physically active as they’d like to be. Dephy is also adapting the tech for athletic use — the company is working with Nike on a [robotic sneaker project](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/nike-pitches-robotic-sneakers-and-mind-altering-mules-212716340.html).
