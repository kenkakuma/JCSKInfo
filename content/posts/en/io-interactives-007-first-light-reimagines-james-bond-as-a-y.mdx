The creators of the Hitman series have honed their style of- open-ended and spectacle-driven sandboxes across several games, and now they're taking their signature immersive gameplay to the world of James Bond. With 0_07 First Light_, developer IO Interactive is crafting an origin story for the globetrotting British spy, showing how he undertook daring missions at the start of his career to eventually become the world's most infamous agent.

Before the reveal at The Game Awards of _007 First Light_'s newest villain, [played by Lenny Kravitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igTh9ud5Liw), we had an early look at the latest bits of plot for James Bond's origin story as a superspy. We also spoke with cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg about the main inspirations for the game, how Bond's origin taps into decades of lore, and why a good spy story is timeless.

"What I think is kind of baked into doing an origin story for a character like James Bond, is that everyone knows the character and who he's going to become," Emborg said. "But how does he become this character? I think that's an exciting challenge from a storytelling perspective."

IO Interactive's James Bond is young and inexperienced.

While some Bond films and novels have touched upon the early years of the iconic character, _007 First Light_ will be the first attempt at an actual, modernized origin story. As a twenty-something new MI6 recruit, this James Bond, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, is inexperienced and brash, which can result in some operations going off the rails. He still possesses a certain cunning, and near-supernatural levels of charisma and resourcefulness. This presents a solid archetype for the game’s open-ended missions where players will explore tightly designed worlds with a multitude of tasks and objectives to handle – however the players see fit.

While IO Interactive's Hitman series taps into the spy experience, what really separates James Bond from Agent 47 is that he's a far more social character. The social element will play a big part in how players can find ways to distract, or even outright bluff through charisma to sneak into areas.. Emborg explained that James Bond's resourcefulness also makes him a compelling character for a video game, especially one that is all about player agency.

007 First Light will take players to several locations, including Slovakia and what appears to be Vietnam.

"Bond is a competent character,” Emborg said. “We want to give the player the opportunities to have that agency to say, 'Oh, I'm gonna talk to that guy,' or, 'I'm gonna go and punch that guy,’ or, ‘I can probably crawl up into a tight space to sneak in.' Having that sense of agency is pivotal if you want to deliver a full Bond experience. Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience." 

Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both. 

"We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different. We have sandbox locations where you make the open-ended decisions, but we also have other levels where it is a chase or a set-piece encounter, and then it opens up again. So we kind of coined the term, _having a game that breathes_. It's a very different way of playing this type of game that we usually do, so we've definitely bolstered our toolbox for this game."

In many ways, _007 First Light_ is a story that can only be told in an interactive format. The new game will pull from numerous novels and films for its plot, and it also features a large cast of familiar characters seen throughout the franchise – such as MI6 assistant Moneypenny (performed by Kiera Lester), gadget guru and quartermaster Q (played by Alastair Mackenzie), and team leader M (Priyanga Burford). 

But like any singular Bond story, _First Light_ features its own set of original characters. In addition to James Bond's MI6 mentor John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a new core villain, black-market smuggler and warlord Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. It's a familiar setup for a Bond experience for sure, but within the context of a video game – one made by IO Interactive – it really taps looks to tap into the Bond fantasy more than other games have. 

From the gameplay demos and trailers we've seen, IO Interactive looks to be channeling the style and lore from decades of Bond with its modernized reboot of the character. From deep cuts to _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_ – one of the great and underrated Bond movies – and _You Only Live Twice_, _007 First Light_ is keeping a keen eye on paying tribute to what came before.

"At the very beginning, it was very much like a maelstrom of \[ideas\], then suddenly something emerges, and you build up a story around it," Emborg said. He continued, “I love doing this stuff and with great reverence for the material. It's a privilege to work in this universe. James Bond is one of the few IPs that still hasn't been overdone, in my view. We have a space to come in with a fresh take, and he's a character who's seen a lot of versions over the years."

Confirmed MI6 gadgets include the "Q-Watch."

So far, _007 First Light_ has the makings of not only the biggest Bond game but also the most true-to-life simulation of being a superspy. While previous Bond games like _Goldeneye_ and _Everything or Nothing_ are well-loved classics, they embody traditional video game shooting spectacle. _007 First Light_ is looking to lean into the immersive element of the Hitman games in its adaptation of James Bond, finally giving players the opportunities to explore the social aspects of spy work on a grand scale. 

_007 First Light_ will arrive on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
