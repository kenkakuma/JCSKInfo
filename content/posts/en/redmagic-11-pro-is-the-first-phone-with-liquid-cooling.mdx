What looks like the spot for Qi2 charging is actually an excuse to show off the liquid cooling.

Redmagic’s latest gaming phone has arrived in China with a neat trick up its sleeve: liquid cooling.

It’s an active liquid cooling system, as opposed to the passive vapor chamber systems that have become pretty common in high-end Android phones over the last few years, with a ceramic micro-pump to push liquid through the phone. It’s a first for phones, outside of a [concept device built by OnePlus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23615772/oneplus-11-concept-phone-cooling-mwc-activecryoflux-blue-veins) in 2023. Naturally, the design makes sure to show it off, with a translucent ring to highlight the moving coolant.

The other big selling point is a huge 8,000mAh battery, bigger even than the 7,500mAh cells in recent [Xiaomi](https://www.theverge.com/news/785693/xiaomi-17-pro-max-china-launch-specs-price-second-screen) and [Oppo](https://www.theverge.com/news/800600/oppo-find-x9-pro-launch-china-telephoto-extender) phones. A Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 handles the performance, with a 144Hz display, 120W wired charging, and haptic shoulder buttons too. Redmagic says a global launch will be announced November 3rd.
