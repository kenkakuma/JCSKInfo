_Battlefield 6's_ free battle royale game [is now available for download](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-the-new-free-to-play-battle-royale-launches-today/)_._ This follows [numerous leaks](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dataminers-claim-mysterious-granite-files-related-to-this-weeks-patch-could-be-a-shadowdrop-for-its-battle-royale-mode/) that have been popping up ever since the [mainline game hit store shelves](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-finally-a-trailer-for-battlefield-6-but-no-multiplayer-details-just-yet-170144110.html) on October 10.

It's called _Battlefield: Redsec_ and it's free for everyone. You don't need the full-priced game to play. This puts it in direct competition with Call of Duty's own free-to-play battle royale, _Warzone_.

_Redsec_ has a few gameplay modes. There's the usual battle royale, with a big ole map that allows for up to 48 simultaneous players. This mode offers four gameplay classes, plenty of weapons to choose from and unique objectives that reward players with "powerful items." The end goal, as always, is to be the last soldier standing.

There's also a duo mode that lets two players jump into a battle royale at once. This version is intended for newcomers, so it gives access to a smaller map.

The Gauntlet mode offers a twist on a traditional battle royale. Eight squads of four players compete "in a series of special operations that push every squad to their limit." EA says this is perfect for those who like traditional multiplayer FPS games. Users create custom loadouts and completing various objectives awards the team with points.

Finally, there's integration with the Battlefield Portal toolset. This lets players design their own experiences. EA gives examples of a battle royale match that just allows access to sledgehammers or one with only headshots. These tools are also free.

We don't know how or if this battle royale will interact with the main game. _Warzone_ typically includes a story that ties into whatever's going on with Call of Duty's seasonal content drops. To that end, Season 1 of _Battlefield 6_ also releases on October 28. This update includes new maps, modes, vehicles, guns, attachments and cosmetic items.

_Battlefield: Redsec_ is available on every platform that _Battlefield 6_ is available on, including PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S. This could end up being a pretty big hit for EA, as the main game managed to sell [7 million copies in three days](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html).

**Update, October 28 2025, 12:40PM ET**: This story has been updated to include new gameplay details.
