Amazon has [confirmed](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026) that it’s letting go of 16,000 workers and employees across its organization. In an announcement by company SVP Beth Galetti, she explained that Amazon was going through organizational changes to reduce layers and remove bureaucracy. Affected employees in the US will be given 90 days to look for another internal role and will receive severance pay if they do not find any. Galetti also said that Amazon doesn’t have plans to announce “broad reductions every few months” but admitted that the company could “make adjustments as appropriate.”

News about the layoffs was leaked in an email mistakenly sent out early to workers, along with a calendar invitation for a meeting dubbed internally as “Project Dawn.” In the email seen by [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/premature-amazon-layoff-email-touches-off-social-media-panic) and the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo), Amazon Web Services Senior Vice President Colleen Aubrey told workers that their “impacted colleagues” from the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been notified. “Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” Aubrey reportedly wrote in the email.

Amazon [eliminated 14,000 roles](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-cuts-its-workforce-by-14000-in-further-embrace-of-ai-125548323.html) back in October 2025 across its games, logistics, payment and cloud computing divisions, with the availability of AI technologies being one of the main reasons for the layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Amazon said in its announcement back then. This new round of layoffs is just a continuation of the previous one, as Amazon was reportedly looking to let 30,000 people go from the start.

The announcement comes shortly after Amazon revealed that it was [shutting down](https://www.engadget.com/general/amazon-go-and-fresh-stores-are-closing-as-amazon-focuses-on-grocery-delivery-and-whole-foods-180448412.html) its remaining Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores and will focus on grocery deliveries instead. To note, Amazon’s year-over-year net sales grew by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2025 alone. Its net income increased to $21.2 billion compared to the $15.3 billion it posted in the third quarter of 2024.
