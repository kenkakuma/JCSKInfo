Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently went on [record](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-says-ai-needs-to-prove-its-worth) saying that AI still needs to prove its worth if society is to adopt it long-term, but he presumably thinks his company has cracked it with its latest innovation: AI coloring books.

A new Microsoft Paint [feature](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2026/01/21/notepad-and-paint-updates-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/) currently rolling out to Windows Insiders allows you to generate coloring book pages based on the text prompt you enter. The example Microsoft uses is "a cute fluffy cat on a donut," to which the AI tool will spit out a set of slightly different options based on your prompt.

You can then choose which image you want, add it to your current workspace, copy or save it. Presumably you can also print it out for the purpose of entertaining your kids. No doubt the kind of real-world impact the Microsoft chief was alluding to.

The coloring book feature is exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, and Microsoft is also adding a fill tolerance slider that lets you adjust the precision with which the Fill tool adds color to your canvas.

As well as Paint’s new Coloring book feature, Microsoft has also improved its Write, Rewrite and Summarize AI functionality in [Notepad](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=9c684b1e-34b7-44ba-84cc-28ec2fd24327&featureId=text-link&linkText=Notepad&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi1nYi93aW5kb3dzL2VuaGFuY2UteW91ci13cml0aW5nLXdpdGgtYWktaW4tbm90ZXBhZC00MDg4Yjk1NC1jOTdiLTQ2ZGMtODEzZi05NTliZTAxNzQ2ZDUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjljNjg0YjFlLTM0YjctNDRiYS04NGNjLTI4ZWMyZmQyNDMyNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tZ2Ivd2luZG93cy9lbmhhbmNlLXlvdXItd3JpdGluZy13aXRoLWFpLWluLW5vdGVwYWQtNDA4OGI5NTQtYzk3Yi00NmRjLTgxM2YtOTU5YmUwMTc0NmQ1In0&signature=AQAAAQEZpndR7_4OdS5MKacGLTXxdX9Xd4AE5PFU1QmURLAu&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fwindows%2Fenhance-your-writing-with-ai-in-notepad-4088b954-c97b-46dc-813f-959be01746d5), which integrates with GPT to fine-tune your writing and summarize complex notes. You’ll need to sign into your Microsoft account to use cloud features, but results will now appear more quickly and let you interact with the preview without having to wait for its full response. Again, you’ll need to be Windows Insider in the Canary and Dev channels on Windows 11 to take advantage of the updates initially.
