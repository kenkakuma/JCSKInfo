Analogue just announced [new colorways](https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-funtastic) for its recently-launched Analogue 3D console. The appropriately-named Funtastic limited-edition consoles are heavily inspired by Nintendo's translucent N64 models from the late 1990s. Analogue even [borrowed the Funtastic branding](https://consolevariations.com/blog/every-nintendo-64-console-variation-ever-complete-color-list).

In other words, these are going for the nostalgic jugular for gamers of a certain age. There's even a see-through green colorway that calls to mind the Nintendo 64 variant that shipped as a bundle with _Donkey Kong 64_. Just imagine booting up that bad boy as you roam around the house spouting the lyrics of the [DK rap song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npuuTBlEb1U).

There are eight translucent colors to choose from and accompanying 8BitDo controllers available as a separate purchase. The consoles cost $300 and the controllers are priced out at $45.

The Analogue 3D Funtastic consoles go on sale on December 10 at 11AM ET, with the company promising they'll ship within 48 hours to ensure delivery by Christmas. The company is also restocking the traditional colors, which will be available for purchase at the same time but won't ship until January.

We praised the Analogue 3D [in our official review](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html). It's a fantastic way to play N64 cartridges, even if the original games don't always hold up. The 4K CRT emulation is top-notch and the overall hardware design is solid.
