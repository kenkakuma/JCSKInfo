Netflix has crashed for what seemed to be thousands of viewers after the first four episodes of [Stranger Things season 5](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-drops-one-more-stranger-things-trailer-before-season-five-begins-152951886.html) went live for streaming. [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/status/netflix/) started getting an unusual number of outage reports at around 10 minutes before 8PM Eastern time, when the episodes were scheduled to hit the service. The numbers climbed up to almost 14,000 before they went down over the next few minutes.

According to [_Entertainment Weekly_](https://ew.com/netflix-outages-spike-as-stranger-things-season-5-starts-streaming-11858301), affected viewers were getting an NSEZ-403 error, which means their accounts couldn’t connect to Netflix. They were seeing “Something went wrong” and “Sorry, we're having trouble with your request” messages on their screens. For the NSEZ-403 error, in particular, Netflix advises switching to a different device. It’s worth nothing that the show’s creator previously said that Netflix increased its bandwidth by 30 percent to avoid a crash for the season premier. The company has told Engadget that some members briefly experienced an issue streaming on TVs, but that service has been restored for all accounts within 5 minutes.

In season 5 of _Stranger Things,_ the Hawkins gang is set to face Vecna one last time. After these first four episodes, Netflix is dropping three more on December 25 and then the finale itself on December 31.

**Update, Nov. 26, 2025, 10:56PM ET:** This story and its headline have been updated to include the information Netflix shared with Engadget.
