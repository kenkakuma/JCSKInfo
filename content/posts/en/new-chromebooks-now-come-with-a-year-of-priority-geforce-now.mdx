The rise of cloud-based streaming for games has made it possible to play plenty of high-profile games on Chromebooks — not natively, but when you’re using a primarily web-based platform you’ll take what you can get. As of today, Google’s [making it easier](https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebooksgeforce-now-fast-pass/) for new Chromebook buyers to play games right out of the box. Anyone who buys a Chromebook will get 12 months of access to GeForce Now, NVIDIA’s cloud-streaming service that lets you access games you own on platforms like Steam, Xbox and so forth.

It’s not just the standard GeForce Now access, either. Google says this new “Fast Pass” tier has no ads and lets Chromebook users skip the queues that free members have to wait in. Of course, there are some restrictions: this plan only provides 10 hours of gameplay a a month. Since GeForce Now already has a free tier, I presume that after the 10 hours is up you’ll just get dropped down to that experience, which removes priority queue access, has ads and limits you to one-hour sessions. You’re also capped at 1080p and 60 fps, but that should be fine for most Chromebooks.

This is the latest attempt by Google to inject some gaming life into the Chromebook platform. A few years ago, some of Google’s hardware partners released Chromebook models [built with cloud-based gaming in mind](https://www.engadget.com/google-cloud-gaming-chromebooks-asus-lenovo-acer-130030080.html), and Google also was working on [bringing Steam to Chrome OS.](https://www.engadget.com/steam-for-chromebooks-alpha-preview-174030567.html) Even though Steam worked pretty well, Google has reportedly decided to [nix the project](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-for-chromebooks-is-reportedly-being-discontinued-194020340.html) going forward. And I haven’t heard much about the Chromebooks for gaming initiative recently either — but that matters less if any Chromebook with decent specs can take advantage of services like GeForce Now.
