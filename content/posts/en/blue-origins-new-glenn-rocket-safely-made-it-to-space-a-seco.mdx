Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket has completed its second flight, [_The Washington Post_ reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/11/13/new-glenn-blue-origin-nasa-launch/). The rocket launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday, and successfully separated from its first-stage booster, which later landed on a sea platform Blue Origin calls "Jacklyn."

The launch marks the first time the space startup has been able to catch a New Glenn booster for later reuse. The [maiden flight](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-launches-into-orbit-on-its-maiden-flight-073451555.html) of the rocket in January was successful in the sense that it got New Glenn into space, but Blue Origin wasn't able to save the booster from a watery grave. The company hoped to launch its second New Glenn mission on November 9, but [cancelled it](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenns-second-flight-due-to-bad-weather-214349212.html) last minute due to weather.

New Glenn's second mission is also notable because of its payload: The rocket ferried [NASA satellites](https://www.engadget.com/science/blue-origins-second-new-glenn-launch-will-carry-real-nasa-satellites-153000627.html) to space that are destined for Mars as part of the agency's [ESCAPADE mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/escapade/). Considering SpaceX's close relationship with NASA, Blue Origin working with the agency could be an important vote of confidence. 

It could also mean New Glenn is in a good position to help another company founded by Jeff Bezos accelerate its satellite plans. _The Post_ writes that Blue Origin has an existing agreement with Amazon to launch its recently rebranded [Amazon Leo](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/amazon-rebrands-its-starlink-competitor-to-amazon-leo-214453569.html) satellites into space. Leo is positioned as a competitor to Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service.

While SpaceX has completed [many more launches](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-will-attempt-starships-11th-flight-test-on-monday-204237829.html) with its Starship rocket than Blue Origin has, it's also had more than a few [explosive failures](https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html) along the way. Blue Origin still needs more missions under its belt, but if it can repeat its success with New Glenn, it could prove to be a threat to SpaceX.
