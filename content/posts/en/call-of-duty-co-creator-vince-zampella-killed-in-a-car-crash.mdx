Game developer Vince Zampella, known for his work on many popular first-person shooter franchises, has died. According to Los Angeles news channel [_NBC4_](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/), Zampella was killed in a single-vehicle car crash on Sunday along with one other unnamed person. He was 55.

Zampella has helmed several well-known first-person shooter titles. He was a founder of Infinity Ward, where he was a creator of the Call of Duty series. Zampella remained at the company for the launch of the hugely popular franchise's first few installments. In 2010, he co-founded Respawn Entertainment, the studio behind _Titanfall_, _Titanfall 2_ and _Apex Legends_. Respawn was acquired by EA, and most recently, Zampella was leading DICE's studio in Los Angeles and headed up the Battlefield franchise, another FPS series that just saw the launch of [_Battlefield 6_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-copies-in-three-days-181826351.html) earlier this year.

EA shared the following statement about Zampella's death: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”

**Update, December 22, 2025, 3:53PM ET:** Added statement from EA.
