Apple Music and Apple TV were briefly down during outage, according to [Apple’s System Status page](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=26f8cfe4-c1e9-4ebf-97ba-995a63248b54&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Apple&linkText=Apple%E2%80%99s+System+Status+page&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc3VwcG9ydC9zeXN0ZW1zdGF0dXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNmY4Y2ZlNC1jMWU5LTRlYmYtOTdiYS05OTVhNjMyNDhiNTQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0L3N5c3RlbXN0YXR1cy8ifQ&signature=AQAAATAY74J6mNeG6XhXhU33EVkrrdj5qB7XQlkLoi_LOP9E&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F). The outage was logged on Apple’s own system at around 2:53PM ET and affected both of the company’s streaming services, along with Apple TV’s Channels feature, until the company resolved the issue around 4:31PM ET.

On DownDetector, reports of issues with [Apple TV](https://downdetector.com/status/apple-tv/) and [Apple Music](https://downdetector.com/status/apple-music/) first appeared right around 2:33PM ET, a little before Apple officially confirmed the outage on its own site. Only “some” users were affected by the outage, according to Apple, and anecdotally, multiple members of Engadget’s staff were still able to stream content while the services were reportedly out.

Engadget has reached out to Apple for more information on the outage and how many people were impacted. We’ll update this article if we hear back.

Apple relies on cloud services from third-party companies like Amazon, and is ultimately only as stable the data centers it’s paying for. In October 2025, the company was impacted by the same [Amazon Web Services outage](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-aws-outage-has-knocked-services-like-alexa-snapchat-fortnite-venmo-and-more-offline-142935812.html) that took down services and apps like Alexa, Fortnite and Snapchat for hours.  
  
**Update, December 10, 5:09PM ET:** Article and headline updated to reflect that the outage has been resolved.
