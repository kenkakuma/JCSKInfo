Oracle announced today the rollout of new AI agents embedded across its Fusion Cloud Applications suite, marking a significant push into enterprise artificial intelligence automation at no additional cost to customers. The announcement, made at Oracle AI World 2025 in Las Vegas, positions Oracle to compete directly with Microsoft and Salesforce in the rapidly expanding enterprise AI market.

The new AI agents span Oracle's core business applications, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Capital Management (HCM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Customer Experience (CX) functions. Built using Oracle AI Agent Studio for Fusion Applications, the agents automate complex workflows from invoice processing and financial planning to HR management and customer service operations.

**AI Agent Marketplace Expands Partner Ecosystem**

Oracle simultaneously launched the Fusion Applications AI Agent Marketplace, enabling customers to deploy validated, partner-built AI agents with one-click deployment. The marketplace features contributions from major system integrators including IBM, Infosys, KPMG, Wipro, Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC, alongside independent software vendors such as Stripe and Box.​

"The age of intelligent automation has arrived, and in order to stay competitive, organizations need AI solutions that are powerful, scalable, and easy to adopt," said Chris Leone, executive vice president of Applications Development at Oracle. The marketplace differentiates itself by being embedded natively within Oracle Fusion Applications, allowing customers to access and deploy third-party agents directly within existing workflows.​

**Enterprise AI Competition Intensifies**

The announcement comes as enterprise software providers race to deploy agentic AI capabilities. Oracle's AI Agent Studio now supports multiple large language models including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, and xAI. More than 32,000 certified experts have completed training on building agents within the platform.​

Oracle's strategy contrasts with competitors by offering the agents at no additional cost, potentially removing budget constraints that typically limit AI experimentation. The company reported a $455 billion backlog in recent quarters, providing significant revenue visibility as it invests in AI capabilities. According to IDC analyst Mickey North Rizza, "Oracle customers will be uniquely able to accelerate AI adoption" through the integrated marketplace approach.​
