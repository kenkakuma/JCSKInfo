Sony's CES 2026 press conference is just days away, but this year has a twist: Instead of an overview of Sony's electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will apparently have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. That's because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn't just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. This year, however, we'll also apparently get to see a an all-new concept model at the event, too. 

## How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference

The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the [Afeela official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@shmafeela). (We'll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)

## What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES

What's now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations [since CES 2020](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-opens-afeela-1-ev-reservations-at-ces-2025-011826937.html), where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget's automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV "[feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html)," and that "the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago." Ouch.

But the Afeela 1 won't be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase "several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model," Sony Honda Mobility [said in a press release](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/).

We're hoping to hear about what's new and improved at CES 2026, and we're also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we're hoping we'll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.
