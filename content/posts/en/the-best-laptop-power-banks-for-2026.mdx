Laptop power banks come in handy if you often travel or work away from your desk. These larger batteries have enough capacity to refill your computer to around 75 percent, giving you many more productive hours. Of course, they can also charge smaller devices like your phone, camera or tablet a few times over. Nearly all portable laptop chargers fall below the 100-watt-hour mark so you can bring them in your carry-on when you fly. Additional features, like built-in cables and digital displays make these battery banks easier to use, too. We tested over a dozen options and put our thoughts below, so you can find the best laptop power bank for your next trip away from an outlet.

## Best laptop power banks for 2026

## What to look for in a laptop power bank

### **Flying with a laptop power bank**

Most portable batteries top out at around 27,000mAh so you can fly with them. The [TSA currently limits](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries) the capacity carry-on batteries to 100Wh, which works out to around 27,500mAh for 3.6 volt lithium-ion batteries. Note that you’re not allowed to pack _any_ batteries in your checked luggage, regardless of capacity. The TSA rules are intended to limit fire danger — and some airlines are implementing further restrictions due to recent on-board incidents.

In March 2025, a Hong Kong flight was grounded after [a battery pack caught fire](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b10ec1f-8e62-4410-8957-c54f7db63bfc&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Independent&linkText=a+battery+pack+caught+fire&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy1hbmQtYWR2aWNlL2hvbmcta29uZy1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1iYW5rLWIyNzE5MTY0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY28udWsvdHJhdmVsL25ld3MtYW5kLWFkdmljZS9ob25nLWtvbmctYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWZpcmUtcG93ZXItYmFuay1iMjcxOTE2NC5odG1sIn0&signature=AQAAARaZmqqayZq2nqALs3x0b-SI5pZDLbayl9Xy7vJ7jId4&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fnews-and-advice%2Fhong-kong-airlines-flight-fire-power-bank-b2719164.html) in an overhead bin. A similar situation happened that same year in July on a domestic [Delta flight,](https://www.the-independent.com/travel/delta-lithium-battery-explosion-b2785087.html) and again in August on a transatlantic [KLM flight](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-smoke-plane-cabin-midflight-portable-phone-charger-fire/). As a result, some airlines, including [Emirates](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html), [Southwest](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk) and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs.

Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies.

### **Capacity**

If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about [any of the best power banks will do](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html). But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh.

If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank's specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy.

Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.

### **Ports**

Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible. 

Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device _and_ charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates.

Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device.

Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling.

### **Wireless charging**

Since I first started testing portable power banks a few years ago, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups.

Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections.

### **Design**

All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first.

## How we test portable laptop chargers

For the past three years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our [other battery guide](https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html). Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher.

I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15 or 16), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled.

For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That's when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN.

For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design.

For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used:

*   iPhone 15: 3,349mAh
    
*   Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh
    
*   iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh
    
*   16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh

The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself.

But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too.

## Laptop power bank FAQs

### **How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks?**

The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge.

### **How do you fast charge a power bank?**

You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord.

### **What size power bank do I need for a laptop?**

Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops.

### **How many mAh to charge a laptop?**

A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop.

Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as [that calculation](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=30d072b7-7973-41b4-a737-1ec377f5fbf6&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Goal+Zero&linkText=that+calculation&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dvYWx6ZXJvLmNvbS9wYWdlcy93YXR0YWdlLWNhbGN1bGF0b3IiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2FsemVyby5jb20vcGFnZXMvd2F0dGFnZS1jYWxjdWxhdG9yIn0&signature=AQAAAZAoNSNAK2PEx3aooXTpsHfiMd2Y4p7JIDJ0pgc2xQFm&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgoalzero.com%2Fpages%2Fwattage-calculator) takes voltage into account.
