Amazon [is introducing](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/one-medical-ai-health-assistant) an AI-powered assistant to One Medical, the tech-forward primary care provider it [acquired in 2023](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html). Dubbed 'Health AI,' Amazon says the tool "provides 24/7 personalized health guidance based on your medical records."

The company says Health AI can explain lab results, help manage medications, and book appointments for patients. Amazon also says it can "analyze images" but doesn't specify whether this means medical imaging or user uploaded photos. While the company specifically says the tool "complements, but does not replace," a patient's healthcare provider, it also vaguely says the AI can "answer general and complex health questions" while "considering your unique health history."

"Health AI recognizes when symptoms, situations, or specific queries require or benefit from human clinical judgment," reads the company's announcement, while giving few details on just how much medical advice the AI tool is empowered to give.

Use of AI tools brings up data privacy concerns, and Amazon says it follows HIPAA-compliant privacy and security practices. The company says that a user's conversations with Health AI are "not automatically added to your medical record." This of course implies the option to do just that. It also says the company doesn't sell members' protected health information.

One Medical has a limited number of brick-and-mortar offices in major metros throughout the US, but the focus of the company seems to be telehealth services. These services are offered as part of an annual subscription, which is discounted for Amazon Prime members. This is only the latest investment Amazon has made in the healthcare space. In recent years the tech giant has begun [same-day prescription deliveries](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-to-bring-same-day-prescription-deliveries-to-nearly-half-of-the-us-next-year-185708164.html) in certain markets, and built [vending machines](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-will-start-dispensing-prescription-drugs-through-vending-machines-144555105.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawPd8mlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFGT3lLbzZrZ3hId0pZNjZ1c3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHpe-fTo1JrZmaAazc6tqECMSX6AJDGbRmJXL0JBoRoTrXQplBl6ivlbWzFzB_aem_BvXaJ7UFhzyxfe13R-FJ7g) for prescription drugs.

Health AI follows the trend of AI companies competing to enter healthcare with their AI-powered chatbots. Google added an AI health coach to the Fitbit app [last year](https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-health-coach-will-soon-be-available-to-some-fitbit-premium-users-170022769.html), and OpenAI announced a [dedicated health portal](https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-is-launching-a-new-dedicated-health-portal-210150083.html) within ChatGPT in January.
