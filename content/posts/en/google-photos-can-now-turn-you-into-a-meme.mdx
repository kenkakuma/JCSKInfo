In Big Tech's never-ending quest to [increase AI adoption](https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html), Google has unveiled a meme generator. The new Google Photos feature, [Me Meme](https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos), lets you create personalized memes starring a synthetic version of you.

Google describes Me Meme as "a simple way to explore with your photos and create content that's ready to share with friends and family." You can choose from a variety of templates or "upload your own funny picture" to use in their place.

The feature isn't live for everyone yet, so you may not yet have access to it. (A Google representative [told](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/google-photos-latest-feature-lets-you-meme-yourself/) _TechCrunch_ that the feature will roll out to Android and iOS users over the coming weeks.) But once it arrives, you can use it in the Google Photos app by tapping **Create** (at the bottom of the screen), then **Me Meme**. It will then ask you to choose a template and add a reference photo. There’s an option to regenerate it if you don’t like the result.

Google says Me Meme works best with well-lit, focused and front-facing portrait photos. "This feature is still experimental, so generated images may not perfectly match the original photo," the company [warns](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16763021).
