Russia has blocked the popular gaming platform _Roblox_, [according to a report by _Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/). The country's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor accused the developers of distributing extremist materials and "LGBT propaganda." The agency went on to say that _Roblox_ is "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children."

This is just the latest move the country has taken against what it calls the "international LGBT movement." It recently pressured the language-learning app Duolingo into [deleting references](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/duolingo-deletes-lgbt-references-russia-warning-moscow-rcna155590) to what the country calls "non-traditional sexual relations."

Russian courts regularly issue fines to organizations that violate its "LGBT propaganda" law, [which criminalizes the promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/russia-passes-law-banning-lgbt-propaganda-adults) of same-sex relationships. President Vladimir Putin has called the protection of gay and transgender rights a move "towards open satanism."

_Roblox_ doesn't have a "LGBT propaganda" problem because there's no such thing, but the platform does have plenty of issues that Russia doesn't seem all that concerned about. It's a [noted haven for child predators](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/), which has caused other countries like [Iraq and Turkey](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/turkey-has-blocked-roblox-over-child-exploitation-reports-120018044.html) to ban the platform. To its credit, the company has [begun cracking down on user-generated content](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/roblox-cracks-down-on-its-user-created-content-following-multiple-child-safety-lawsuits-193452150.html) and added new age-based restrictions.

_Roblox_ is still one of the more popular entertainment platforms in the world. It averaged over [151 million daily active users](https://mashable.com/article/roblox-age-estimation) in the third quarter of this year alone.
