Apple deals can be hard to come by, but right now you can save on one of the company's smallest (and arguably one if its most useful) gadgets. A four-pack of [Apple AirTags](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&itemId=amazon_B0D54JZTHY&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c736f11a-2f32-4db0-9b83-3ad98a4dacbb&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon+Canada&linkText=Apple+AirTags&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLU1YNTQyTEwtQS1BaXJUYWctUGFjay9kcC9CMEQ1NEpaVEhZLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNzM2ZjExYS0yZjMyLTRkYjAtOWI4My0zYWQ5OGE0ZGFjYmIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vQXBwbGUtTVg1NDJMTC1BLUFpclRhZy1QYWNrL2RwL0IwRDU0SlpUSFkvIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&signature=AQAAAa_il4iDQfPViDGoHNVygCNZ7aSLTNKwTCzvf2mXjb6S&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%2F) is down to $65 right now, which is 34 percent off its usual price. That brings each AirTag in the bundle down to $16.25 each. If you're an Apple user, then the AirTag is the [best Bluetooth tracker](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html) on the market for you.

You can put these little discs in your wallet, in a backpack or in your luggage while you're traveling. Your AirTag's location will show up in your Find My app, powered by the vast network of iPhones, iPads and other compatible devices that receive the AirTag's Bluetooth signal. Keep in mind these only work when close enough to participating devices to be located.

You can attach AirTags to just about anything thanks to an abundance of available [accessories](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html). Their built-in speakers can play a tone, triggered from your iPhone, to help you find them when the object they're affixed to is lost. On iPhone 11 and newer models, you can take advantage of the AirTag's Ultra Wideband capability and have your phone lead you right to your AirTag, complete with directional arrows on your iPhone screen.
