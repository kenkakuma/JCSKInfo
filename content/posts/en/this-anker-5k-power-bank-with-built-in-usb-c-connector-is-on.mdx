A portable battery is a necessity now, especially if your phone's battery has seen better days. But a portable battery is useless if you don't have the proper cords to connect your devices to it, so you often need to remember to pack more than just one thing. A few battery packs solve that problem, including [Anker's Nano Power Bank](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&itemId=amazon_B0C6XK77HJ&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b69ef8fd-c929-449d-8064-4d8fb2e0824b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon+Canada&linkText=Anker%27s+Nano+Power+Bank&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Fua2VyLUZvbGRhYmxlLUNvbm5lY3Rvci1Qb3J0YWJsZS1DaGFyZ2VyL2RwL0IwQzZYSzc3SEo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjY5ZWY4ZmQtYzkyOS00NDlkLTgwNjQtNGQ4ZmIyZTA4MjRiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Fua2VyLUZvbGRhYmxlLUNvbm5lY3Rvci1Qb3J0YWJsZS1DaGFyZ2VyL2RwL0IwQzZYSzc3SEoiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAXDtl8mSis7Innah_ZPcmHZs9W-jBEv3gAHKHeTbniuR&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Foldable-Connector-Portable-Charger%2Fdp%2FB0C6XK77HJ).

Now our choice for [best portable charger for Android](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html) is even more tempting, thanks to a 36 percent markdown. The Anker Nano Power Bank is down to $19 from $30 in the USB-C model. The discount is available in the classic Black or White and the more fun colors Ice Lake Blue, Lilac Purple and Sprout Green. 

You can use Anker's Nano Power Bank with devices such as the iPhone 15 and newer, Samsung S22 and S23 series, [AirPods](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html) and the iPad Pro or Air. It's good for a quick boost: we found that its 5,000mAh battery can charge a depleted Galaxy S23 Ultra to 65 percent in about an hour. It also has four indcator lights on it that show how much it's charged.
