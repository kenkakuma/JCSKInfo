Rode is today launching the Rodecaster Video S, a smaller and cheaper version of its existing all-in-one production console. The [Rodecaster Video](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-rodecaster-video-packs-audio-and-video-production-features-into-one-mighty-console-160015714.html) is targeted at professionals and environments regularly producing multi-camera content. The S, meanwhile, is aimed at bedroom streamers, video podcasters and other indie creators with more modest production needs. Consequently, the focus here is on trimming down unnecessary features to get the price to a more reasonable $500.

It’s easy to spot the differences by sight alone, since the hardware is smaller than its bigger sibling. It’s got fewer input and scene buttons, and is clad in plastic, rater than metal, since it probably won’t need to be moved around a lot. The number of HDMI inputs/outputs drops from 4/2 on the original to 3/1 here, and there’s only one multi-function USB-C port. Similarly, there’s only two headphone outputs here, and you’ll only get 24GB internal storage rather than the microSD-card slot found on the original.

The Rodecaster Video S is available to pre-order today, with units expected to ship across December, depending on your territory.
