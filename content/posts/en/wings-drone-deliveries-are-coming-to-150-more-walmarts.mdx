Don't be surprised if you see even more [drones delivering](https://www.engadget.com/apps/uber-will-once-again-test-delivering-food-by-drone-this-year-120017602.html) groceries across the US since the Alphabet-owned [Wing](https://wing.com/news/wing-walmart-expand-drone-delivery-coast-to-coast) announced another service expansion with Walmart over the next year. The partnership said that drone delivery services will be available at 150 more Walmart locations in Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Miami and more metros that have yet to be announced.

According to Wing, its top 25 percent of customers have ordered its delivery drones up to three times a week. To meet growing demand, Wing and Walmart said it will serve up to 40 million US customers and build up a network of 270 delivery locations by 2027. The partnership [launched its service](https://www.engadget.com/wing-and-walmart-will-offer-six-mile-drone-deliveries-over-dallas-204501938.html) in August 2023 with the inaugural deliveries offered to the Dallas-Fort Worth customer base. In June 2025, Wing and Walmart increased drone delivery coverage to 100 more stores across Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando and Tampa. Last month, the two companies launched their delivery service in Atlanta and are planning to kick off deliveries in Houston on January 15.

Before Walmart, Wing broke into the US market by working with [Walgreens](https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-wing-drone-delivery-service-comes-to-texas-on-april-7th-120059178.html) to deliver health and wellness products in April 2022. Since then, the Alphabet subsidiary has partnered with [DoorDash](https://www.engadget.com/doordash-wing-drone-delivery-alphabet-australia-171015755.html) and Apian, a London-based healthcare logistics company. Besides its commercial partnerships, Wing has been working on a [larger delivery drone](https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-wing-shows-off-a-larger-delivery-drone-with-a-bigger-payload-capacity-163148392.html) that will be able to fly at up to 65 mph and carry up to five pounds, or double its current capacity.
