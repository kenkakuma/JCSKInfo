[Ubisoft](https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-mousetrap-system-lengthens-lag-punish-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters-020008802.html) has shut down _Rainbow Six Siege_'s servers and is in the process of rolling back the fallout of a widespread breach that left various players with billions of in-game credits, ultra-rare skins of weapons, and banned accounts. As of Sunday afternoon, the [status page](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status) on _Rainbow Six Siege_'s website still shows "unplanned outage" on all servers across PC, PlayStation and Xbox.

The fiasco began Saturday morning when Ubisoft [said on X](https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808?s=20) that they were "aware of an incident currently affecting _Rainbow Six Siege_" and "working on a resolution." A couple of hours later, the _Rainbow Six Siege_ servers were shut down, following plenty of [user reports](https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?s=20) showing either zero or billions in R6 credits, rare skins in their lockers and either account bans or unbans. Ubisoft later clarified Saturday afternoon [on X](https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?s=20) that nobody would be banned if they spent their ill-gotten credits, but that a rollback of all transactions starting from Saturday, 6AM ET would soon be underway.

On Sunday afternoon, Ubisoft informed the playerbase that they're currently performing a rollback, but that "extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes." The company added that "this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed" and didn't provide an estimate for when servers would be back online.
