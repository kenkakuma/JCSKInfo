Amid endless AI hype and a guest visit from the CEO of Hartford Steam Boiler (?!), Samsung had a big surprise for us tonight at CES 2026: A massive 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It’s so large, it’s suspended by a large metal stand that surrounds the entire screen, which also lets you tilt the screen just a bit. (For the Samsung diehards, it’s basically a reinvention of its [“timeless gallery” stand from 2013](https://news.samsung.com/global/part%E2%85%A1-a-timeless-gallery-design-that-redefines-the-space-we-live-in).) I imagine bringing this TV home would be like Bart Simpson adopting his beloved elephant Stampy: Your pets would be terrified, and your family would probably be annoyed at this television dominating so much of your home.

But boy, it sure looks amazing in person. Just like [LG’s Micro RGB set](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html), it’s using an evolved form of Mini LED technology that allows for far better color accuracy and richness. As I fought through the crowds of Samsung’s CES First Look event to catch a glimpse of it, I couldn’t help but notice how everyone just looked a bit stunned, like the monkeys from _2001_ seeing the monolith for the first time.

Samsung representatives were clear that this Micro RGB set was only a concept of what the company could do with the technology, it’s not an actual product it plans to ship. In another demo, Samsung took the 130-inch screen and mounted it directly on a wall (below). Of course, it still looked stunning. I also learned that if you wanted to wall mount the “timeless gallery” stand concept, you actually have to mount the entire stand to the wall, since it’s part of the TV’s speaker system.

Samsung didn’t have too many details about the technical aspects of the 130-inch Micro RGB TV, but it did shout buzzwords at us during its announcement. it’s powered by the company’s “Micro RGB AI Engine Pro” processor, which includes “Micro RGB Color Booster Pro” and “Micro RGB HDR Pro” technology, using AI to “enhance dull tones and refine contrast, delivering vivid color and subtle detail across bright and dark scenes alike for realism and picture fidelity.”

The Micro RGB set also sports the company’s Glare Free technology to reduce reflections, and it supports HDR 10+ Advanced and the company’s Eclipsa Audio. It can also tap into Samsung’s Vision AI Companion for conversational search, as well as Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity.

But of course, those details really don’t matter, because you won’t be able to buy the 130-inch Micro RGB TV in its current form. We were impressed by last year’s 115-inch model, but its $30,000 price didn’t make it feasible for anyone but the ultra-rich. And those folks would be better off investing in [Samsung’s own Micro LED sets](https://www.engadget.com/a-110000-microled-tv-in-this-economy-144340352.html), which offer the benefits of OLED that Micro RGB does not. (Sure, those TVs start at $110,000, but for that’s not exactly a huge leap for those with deep pockets.)
