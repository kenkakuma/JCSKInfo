Amazon is reportedly adding Teresa Palmer (_The Fall Guy, Warm Bodies, Hacksaw Ridge_) to its pantheon of Norse gods for its _God of War_ TV show adaptation. As first reported by [_Deadline_](https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/), Palmer will play Sif, Thor's wife and eventual leader of the Aesir, in the live-action adaptation. It may not carry as much weight as the casting of the video game's protagonist that was revealed earlier this week to be [Ryan Hurst](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html), but it could hint at the direction the TV show may take.

While Sif plays a minor role in the [_God of War Ragnarok_](https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html) game, the early casting confirmation could indicate that the showrunner, Ronald D. Moore, may give the character a more involved role. In _God of War Ragnarok_, Sif is known as Odin's diplomat before the events of Ragnarok, where she becomes the new leader of the Aesir, one of two tribes of Norse gods. Notably, Amazon's adaptation is still missing the casting confirmations for Atreus, Thor, Odin and many other Norse gods seen in the video game. Even so, the _God of War_ TV show has already secured at least [two seasons](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/amazons-god-of-war-adaptation-gets-a-two-season-order-133059803.html).
