_Elden Ring Nightreign_, the co-op survival take on FromSoftware's massively successful open-world single-player game, is getting a DLC at the end of this year. _The Forsaken Hollows_ [launches](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/) on December 4, 2025. This DLC is the first big content update for the spinoff, although Nightreign did receive previous updates to add improved tuning for the [two-player](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-is-adding-two-player-co-op-next-week-182708700.html) and [solo-player](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-patch-will-make-gameplay-easier-for-solo-players-183644323.html) experiences, as well introducing an even-more-punishing Deep of Night mode. 

The trailer shows exactly the grim, macabre setting and inventive-looking boss designs that we've come to expect from FromSoft. _The Forsaken Hollows_ will add two more character classes for players to choose from. The book-wielding Scholar is an arcane magic user who "gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation." This seems like a good choice for the tactically-minded players, while the new Undertaker class favors faith and strength builds. There will also be a new region to explore and two new bosses.

We learned yesterday that DLC was in the works for Nightreign thanks to a [mention](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/) during the earnings report from parent company Kadokawa, but it seemed the new content might not be ready until early 2026. Hopefully today's announcement will calm the players who have been [review-bombing](https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews) the game on Steam due to the lack of information about updates.
