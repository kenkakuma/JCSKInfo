Meta is rolling out a way for people to interact together in its virtual spaces. Users will now be able to [invite](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e160a5dc-fb38-4e8b-ae1d-1ad5eb060fbd&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b291be0c-58dd-441b-a920-1a460d1ccde2&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Meta&linkText=invite&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL2h5cGVyc2NhcGUtd29ybGRzLXNoYXJpbmctaGFuZ291dC1mcmllbmRzLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1kaWdpdGFsLXJlcGxpY2FzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjI5MWJlMGMtNThkZC00NDFiLWE5MjAtMWE0NjBkMWNjZGUyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL2h5cGVyc2NhcGUtd29ybGRzLXNoYXJpbmctaGFuZ291dC1mcmllbmRzLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1kaWdpdGFsLXJlcGxpY2FzLyJ9&signature=AQAAAUlz9ogp_CwIUnRUhTRIhLeA0WeUORfvMKkQgQU-wPWk&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fhyperscape-worlds-sharing-hangout-friends-metaverse-digital-replicas%2F) friends to hang out in the spaces created with Hyperscape on Meta Horizon. Up to eight people can join an instance, as long as they are age 18 or older and have the link to the space. The virtual spaces can be joined through a Meta Quest 3 or 3S as well as via the Meta Horizon mobile app, which is on both Android and iOS. People can scan their own homes to create a virtual hangout when they can't be in person together, or they can indulge their inner lookieloos and wander around some of the celebrity spaces, such as Gordon Ramsay's kitchen or Chance the Rapper's living room.

It's an application of Hyperscape Capture, which Meta showed off during its [Connect conference](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-connect-2025-live-updates-ray-ban-display-and-more-new-smartglasses-unveiled-160058810.html) earlier this year. That tech allows people to use a Meta Quest to scan real spaces and create digital replicas. The invite option is being gradually added to accounts, and Meta also said that it hopes to raise the party cap in the future for this metaverse feature.
