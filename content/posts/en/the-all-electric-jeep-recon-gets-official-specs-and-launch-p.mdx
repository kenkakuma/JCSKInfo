Jeep says that the all-electric 2026 Jeep Recon will finally begin production "early next year." This comes three years after the model's original announcement amid multiple delayed starts.

Built on a dedicated EV architecture, the Recon will deliver 650 horsepower and 620 ft-lb of torque. Its 100kWh battery pack will have an estimated 250 miles of range on a full charge and accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3.6 seconds.

The Recon is billed as the first and only fully electric Trail Rated SUV in the industry. This means it meets Jeep's internal standards for the traction, water fording, maneuverability, articulation and ground clearance necessary to earn the Trail Rated badge. Bolstered by its 4X4 capability and 33-inch tires, the Recon can tackle a wide range of terrains.

The Jeep Recon was originally supposed to be available in 2024, though the closest we got to seeing it in action was [spy photos](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63148542/2025-jeep-recon-ev-spy-photos/) of a possible prototype at the tail end of that year. Last month Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told [_MotorTrend_](https://www.motortrend.com/news/jeep-recon-ev-still-part-of-jeep-plan) that the Recon was coming to showrooms "next spring." The [Jeep website](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0ab278a2-a9dc-4f7b-8c37-b5cc88078610&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6fd4d630-0757-4e9e-888a-e1fd842564bf&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Jeep&linkText=Jeep+website&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qZWVwLmNvbS9yZWNvbi5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2ZmQ0ZDYzMC0wNzU3LTRlOWUtODg4YS1lMWZkODQyNTY0YmYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplZXAuY29tL3JlY29uLmh0bWwifQ&signature=AQAAAdoUnh_gDThkas66e9rYsHxbjR1LvwmNCI3D_n4BN5U8&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jeep.com%2Frecon.html), which may need some updates, still says "coming late 2025."

Jeep had previously introduced multiple hybrid models including a hybrid version of the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler. Both models were subject to [substantial recalls](https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-recalls-more-than-375000-jeep-hybrid-suvs-for-fire-risk-215341226.html) this year due to fire risks in their batteries, encompassing over 375,000 vehicles. This came after a [similar recall](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/jeep-recalls-194000-plug-in-hybrids-due-to-fire-risks-150059282.html) for Jeep hybrids the year before 194,000 vehicles, also due to fire risks.

The EV will have a starting MSRP of $65,000 and Jeep says production will take place at the Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico.
