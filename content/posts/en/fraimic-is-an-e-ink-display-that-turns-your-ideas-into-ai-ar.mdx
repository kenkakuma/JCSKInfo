It's not the first of its kind, but a few key differences set Fraimic apart from other E Ink art displays. Aura, Switchbot and others have something similar. But unlike other versions, this one requires no subscription, lets you swap out the surrounding frame and doesn’t require an app to upload the art. Instead, a built-in mic picks up your idea, sends it to OpenAI and creates an image that pops up in a few moments on the screen. The on-board accelerometer even knows whether the device is in landscape or portrait orientation, and applies the correct format.

A purchase of the Fraimic comes with 100 free AI creations per year, and if that’s not enough, you can buy more. But if, like me, you don’t consider the images a machine’s brain smashes together to actually be art, the Fraimic also allows you to upload your own images via the brand’s website. And should that website ever go away, your device isn’t obsolete, as it can also handle local uploads.

The other qualities that make E Ink displays intriguing are all here. These screens are similar to what you get with a color [ereader](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ereader-130013808.html) or [E Ink tablet](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html) and, like those devices, only require power when changing what’s displayed. This one has enough juice to last for years — even if you swap out the image once per day.

It uses a 13-inch [Spectra 6](https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Spectra6) E Ink display, which has a resolution of about 200 dots per inch. If you’ve seen a color epaper tablet or ereader, you’ll have an idea of what the image looks like. It’s not high-definition and the colors aren’t super vibrant, but the effect is pleasantly subdued and, for the right images, looks properly arty.

Even under the always-too-bright glare of the CES show floor lights, the images managed to look lush and saturated. With the right (human-generated) art, I’d be happy to hang this in my living room.

The standard-sized display will run you $399, which is $100 cheaper than Aura’s similarly sized device and $50 more than SwitchBot’s. Pre-orders for Fraimic are open now and units are expected to ship in spring of this year.
