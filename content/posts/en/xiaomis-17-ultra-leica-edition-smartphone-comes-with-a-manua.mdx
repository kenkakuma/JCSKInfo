Xiaomi just launched its flagship [17 Ultra by Leica](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=446ec9d6-e442-4d00-972f-5da520b0905e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d606a47e-5a7a-4677-845a-45a0f7212978&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Xiaomi&linkText=17+Ultra+by+Leica&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taS5jb20vcHJvZC94aWFvbWktMTctdWx0cmEtYnlsZWljYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDYwNmE0N2UtNWE3YS00Njc3LTg0NWEtNDVhMGY3MjEyOTc4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taS5jb20vcHJvZC94aWFvbWktMTctdWx0cmEtYnlsZWljYSJ9&signature=AQAAAf7CgUftzbkptNsJzl3RjxVc5npiCpNp1uguw36z5Ptk&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fprod%2Fxiaomi-17-ultra-byleica) phone that may make you feel bad about your current device's cameras. Naturally it's a spec monster, with a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. But it also offers an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring that also activates the camera automatically when you rotate it.

Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness. On top of the impressive main and telephoto lenses, they also offer a 50MP ultrawide and a 50MP selfie camera. And battery life shouldn't be an issue, thanks to the 6,800mAh silicon-carbon battery that supports 90 watt wired and 50 watt wireless charging.

Xiaomi

The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well Leica touches. Those include a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on front, textured edges and film simulations like Leica's Monopan 50 black and white. As for the zoom ring, Xiaomi says "its rotation \[eliminates\] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm." It can also be reprogrammed for functions like exposure compensation and manual focus. 

Other features unique to that model include a "Leica Moments" 3:2 aspect ratio, special encryption chip, and dual-satellite connection. And as befits a special edition, it comes in a custom box with a lens cap, lanyard, magnetic case and branded cleaning cloth.

The one caveat is the price. Where phones for the Chinese market are often cheaper than North American models, Xiaomi's 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra [start at](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_17_ultra_packs_a_1inch_sensor_200mp_periscope_telephoto_and_a_6800mah_battery-news-70863.php) CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995) respectively with 512GB or storage and 16GB of RAM — right up there with the latest high-end [Pixel 10](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html) and [Galaxy 25](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on-faster-curvier-and-way-more-ai-ier-180054396.html) models.
