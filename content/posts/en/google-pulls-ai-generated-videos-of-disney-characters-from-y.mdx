Google seems to be cracking down on the use of Disney characters in AI-generated videos on YouTube after it was [hit with a cease and desist](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html) letter. According to reports by [_Variety_](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/google-removes-ai-videos-disney-characters-cease-desist-1236608015/) and [_Deadline_](https://deadline.com/2025/12/google-takes-down-disney-ai-videos-cease-desist-1236647823/), the company removed dozens of videos featuring Deadpool, Moana, Mickey Mouse, Star Wars characters and other Disney IP as of Friday, just days after [Disney accused it](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/) of "infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale." The letter, seen by both publications earlier this week, called out Google not just for hosting these videos on YouTube, but also for using copyrighted works to train models including Veo and Nano Banana.

Prior to this, [Disney has come after](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-characterai-220204094.html) [Character.AI](http://character.ai/) as well as [Hailuo](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-warner-bros-discovery-and-universal-file-joint-lawsuit-against-generative-ai-app-hailuo-163819825.html) and [Midjourney](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-and-universal-studios-file-suit-against-midjourney-for-copyright-infringement-154206053.html) — both of which it's suing — over AI-related copyright infringement. But, that doesn't mean it's [shunning AI-generated content](https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html) altogether. The company on Friday [announced a deal with OpenAI](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html) that will bring Disney characters to Sora and ChatGPT, and bring AI-generated shorts from Sora to Disney+.
