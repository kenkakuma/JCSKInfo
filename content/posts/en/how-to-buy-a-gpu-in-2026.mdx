One of the toughest parts of any new computer build or upgrade is finding the right video card. In a gaming PC, the GPU is easily the most important part, and you can limit your experience by going with the wrong model. The buying process can be frustrating, especially right now with [memory shortages](https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html) leading to higher prices. In this guide, we'll help you navigate the market and find the right GPU for your needs.

## It's all about the games

The first question to ask yourself is what kind of games do you want to play. Competitive shooters like _Valorant_, _Overwatch_ and _Marvel Rivals_ were designed to run on older hardware. As such, even entry-level GPUs like the GeForce RTX 5060 can push those games at 120 frames per second and above at 1080p (more on why that's important in a moment).

By contrast, if you want to play modern, single-player games with ray tracing and other graphical extras, you'll need a more powerful GPU. Just how much more powerful will depend on the resolution of your monitor.

A 1440p or QHD monitor has 78 percent more pixels than a 1080p screen, and a 4K display has more than twice as many pixels as a QHD panel. In short, running a game at 4K, especially at anything above 60 frames per second, is demanding, and most GPUs will need to use upscaling techniques like NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) to push new games at high refresh rates.

On the subject of resolution, it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of money on a 4K monitor only to pair it with an inexpensive GPU. That's a recipe for a bad experience. As you're shopping for a new video card, you should think about the resolution and frame rate you want to play your games. If you're in the market for both a GPU and display, be sure to check out our guide to the [best gaming monitors](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html).

If your budget allows, a good bet is to buy a midrange card that can comfortably render all but the most demanding games at 1440p and at least 144 frames per second. Put another way, you want a GPU that can saturate a monitor at its native resolution and refresh rate in as many games as possible. That will give you the smoothest possible experience in terms of motion clarity, and allow you to dabble in both competitive shooters and the latest single-player games as the mood strikes you.

## NVIDIA vs AMD and Intel

One of the confusing aspects of the [GPU industry are all the players involved](https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-gpu-market-is-built-on-a-broken-foundation-143100986.html). What you need to know is that there are three main players: AMD, Intel and NVIDIA. They design the cards you can buy, but delegate the manufacturing of them to so-called add-in board (AIB) partners like ASUS, XFX, Gigabyte and others.

As you can imagine, this creates some headaches. The most annoying of which is that AMD, Intel and NVIDIA will often set recommended prices for their graphic cards, only for their partners to sell their versions of those GPUs for more than the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). For example, NVIDIA's website lists the RTX 5070 with a starting price of $549. On Newegg, there are no new [5070s listed at that price](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6ce976db-26d7-4094-a1be-4d1496b213f0&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Newegg&linkText=5070s+listed+at+that+price&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdlZ2cuY29tL3AvcGw_ZD1SVFgrNTA3MCZPcmRlcj0xIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3Njc2ZjcwZS04NzdkLTQyOTMtYWZlMy1mZGJjMjFlOThjN2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2VnZy5jb20vcC9wbD9kPVJUWCs1MDcwJk9yZGVyPTEifQ&signature=AQAAAQ2F8SZhY3upQlXMzs4XYPjfLiB-PVBmTQVX2amoKJiv&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3Fd%3DRTX%2B5070%26Order%3D1). The only models anywhere close to $549 are refurbished and open box specials. If you want one that comes sealed, that will cost you at least $630.

As for what company you should buy your new GPU from, before 2025, NVIDIA was the undisputed king of the market. Specific GeForce cards may have not offered the best rasterization performance in their price range, but between their performance in games with ray tracing and the fact NVIDIA was ahead on features like DLSS, an RTX GPU was a safe bet.

However, with this year's RTX 50 series release (and excluding models like the RTX 5080 and 5090 where there's no competition), it's safe to say NVIDIA missed the mark this generation. If you're in the market for an entry- or mid-level GPU, AMD and Intel offer better value, with cards that come with enough VRAM for now and into the future. That said, there are still a few reasons you might consider an NVIDIA GPU, starting with ray tracing.

### Ray tracing

For decades, developers have used rasterization techniques to approximate how light behaves in the real world, and the results have been commendable. But if you know what to look for, it's easy to see where the illusion falls apart. For that reason, [real-time ray tracing](https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-16-the-future-of-ray-tracing-explainer.html) has been a goal of industry for years, and in 2018 it became a reality with NVIDIA's first RTX cards.

In some games, effects like ray-traced reflections and global illumination are transformational. Unfortunately, those features are expensive to run, often coming at a significant frame rate drop without upscaling. Since ray tracing was optional in many games before 2025, you could save money by buying an AMD GPU. For example, even if the RX 7800 XT was worse at ray tracing than the RTX 4070, the former was often cheaper to buy, had more onboard VRAM and offered as good or better rasterization performance in many games.

However, you can't ignore ray tracing performance anymore. We're starting to see releases like _Doom: The Dark Ages_ where the tech is an integral part of a game's rendering pipeline, and more are likely to follow in the future. Thankfully, AMD's newest cards are much better in that regard, though you'll still get an edge running an NVIDIA model. For that reason, if ray tracing is important to you, NVIDIA cards are still the way to go.

### Refresh rates and frame rates

If you're new to the world of PC gaming, it can be tricky to wrap your head around refresh rates. In short, the higher the refresh rate of a monitor, the more times it can update the image it displays on screen every second, thereby producing a smoother moving picture.

For example, moving elements on a monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate will look better than on one with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, that's dependent on your GPU being able to consistently render a game at the appropriate frame rates. In the case of a 120Hz monitor, you want a GPU with enough headroom to drive most games at 120 fps. Realistically, most video cards won't be able to achieve that in every game, but it's a good baseline to aim for when shopping for a new GPU.

### Frame generation

Since the release of NVIDIA's RTX 40-series GPU, the company has offered a feature called frame generation. As the name suggests, it allows NVIDIA's latest video cards to generate an additional frame for every frame they render normally. With the 50-series, NVIDIA has since begun offering multi-frame generation, which gives those GPUs the ability to generate up to three additional frames for every rendered frame. AMD has its own take on the tech, as does Intel, though NVIDIA's offering is considered superior to both due to how it handles frame pacing.

Frame generation is nice to have, but it's not the silver bullet it might seem. Enabling it will increase system latency, reducing how responsive your games feel. Somewhat unintuitively, high-end GPUs also benefit more from the tech than their entry-level counterparts since they can naturally render more frames. For that reason, it's best to think of frame generation as a way to get the most out of a high refresh rate display.

### Upscaling and latency

I've mentioned DLSS a few times already. Alongside FSR and Intel XeSS, DLSS is an example of what's known as an image reconstruction technology. More and more, native rendering is going out of fashion in game design. With ray tracing and other modern effects enabled, even the most powerful GPUs can struggle to render a game at 1440p or 4K and a playable framerate. That’s why many developers will turn to DLSS, FSR or XeSS to eke out additional performance by upscaling a lower resolution image to QHD or UHD.

Upscaling in games is nothing new. For example, the PS4 Pro used a checkerboard technique to output games in 4K. What’s different now is how modern GPUs go about it. With DLSS, NVIDIA pioneered an approach that uses machine learning to recreate an image at a higher resolution, and in the process, addressed some of the pitfalls of past upscaling methods. If you're sensitive to these sorts of things, there's still blur and shimmer with DLSS, FSR and XeSS, but it's much less pronounced and can lead to significant performance gains.

To DLSS, NVIDIA later added single and multi-frame generation. DLSS is only available on NVIDIA cards, and following the recent release of [DLSS 4.5](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-rolls-out-dlss-45-to-all-rtx-gpus-140000322.html), widely considered to offer the best image quality. That's another reason why you might choose an NVIDIA card over one of its competitors.

However, if you decide to go with an AMD GPU, don't feel like you're missing out. The company recently released FSR 4. While it's not quite on par with DLSS 4 and 4.5 in terms of support and image quality, it's a major leap over FSR 3 and FSR 2.

While on the subject of DLSS, I'll also mention [NVIDIA Reflex](https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reflex-input-lag-202333860.html). It's a latency-reducing technology NVIDIA introduced in 2020. AMD has its own version called [Radeon Anti-Lag](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin/radeon-software-anti-lag.html), but here again Team Green has a slight edge. If you're serious about competitive games, Reflex can significantly reduce input lag, which will make it easier to nail your shots in _Counter-Strike 2_, _Valorant_ and other shooters.

### Driver support

Previously, one of the reasons to pick an NVIDIA GPU over the competition was the company's solid track record of driver support. With one of the company's video cards, you were less likely to run into stability issues and games failing to launch. At the start of 2025, NVIDIA's drivers were abysmal, but the company has since corrected course.

## VRAM

As you're comparing different GPUs, especially those in the same tier, pay close attention to the amount of VRAM they offer. Many modern games will eat up as much VRAM as a GPU can offer, and if your card has a low amount, such as 8GB, you're likely to run into a performance bottleneck.

If your budget allows for it, always go for the model with more VRAM. Consider, for instance, the difference between the $379 RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and [$429 RTX 5060 Ti 16GB](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review-a-solid-semi-budget-gpu-for-429-but-good-luck-scoring-that-price-130058124.html). Spending an extra $50 is going to be a lot for some people, but it's the difference between a card that is only adequate for many recent releases and one that will last you for a few years. In many cases, more VRAM is better.

A slight caveat to this is when comparing models that have different memory bandwidths. A GPU that can access more of its memory faster can outperform one with more memory, even if it has less of it outright. Here, you'll want to read reviews of the models you're comparing to see how they perform in different games.

## Size and power draw

Modern GPUs are big. Most new cards will take up at least two PCI slots on the back of your motherboard. They can also vary dramatically in length, depending on the number of fans the AIB has added to cool the PCB. To be safe, be sure to check the length of the card you want to buy against the maximum clearance listed by your case manufacturer. If you have a radiator at the front of your case, you will also need to factor the size of that in your measurements. The last thing you want is to buy a card that doesn't fit in your case.

Lastly, be sure to check the recommended power supply for the card you want. As a rule of thumb, unless you know what you're doing, it's best to just stick with the manufacturer's recommendation. For instance, NVIDIA suggests pairing the RTX 5070 Ti with a 750 watt PSU. So if you're currently running a 650 watt unit, you'll need to factor in the price of a PSU upgrade with your new GPU.

## Should you buy a used GPU?

It depends. If you can find a deal on an old RTX 40 series GPU, then yes. NVIDIA's RTX 50 series don't offer greatly improved performance over their predecessors, and with most models selling for more than their suggested retail price, it's not the best time to buy a new NVIDIA card.

That said, I suspect finding a good deal on a used GPU will be difficult. Most people will know the value of what they have, and considering the current market, will probably try to get as much as they can for their old card.

You may find better deals on older AMD and Intel GPUs, but I think you're better off spending more now on a new model from one of those companies since the generational gains offered by their latest cards are much more impressive. Simply put, the 9070 XT and B580 are two of the best cards you can buy right now.

Anything older than a card from NVIDIA's 40 series or AMD's RX 6000 family is not worth considering. Unless your budget is extremely tight or you mostly play older games, you're much better off spending more to buy a new card that will last you longer.

## When is a good time to buy a new GPU?

If you've read up to this point, you're probably wondering if it's even worth buying a GPU right now. The answer is (unsurprisingly) complicated. There are a handful of great cards like the Radeon RX 9060 XT and 9070 that are absolutely worth it. The problem is finding any GPU at a price approaching those set by AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.

The AI boom, and [in particular actions by OpenAI](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month), have led to memory shortages. In turn, those shortages have caused the price of consumer GPUs, SSDs and RAM kits to skyrocket in recent months. As of our latest update to this guide, some models like the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti are selling for hundreds of dollars above MSPR.

As such, if you own a relatively recent GPU, you're probably best off trying to hold onto your current card until things settle down. But if your GPU isn't cutting it anymore, you face a difficult decision: overpay now, or wait and potentially pay even more later.

To make that decision easier, I've been maintaining a [separate guide](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/how-to-find-an-affordable-gpu-during-the-great-ramageddon-of-2026-130000654.html) that lists a selection of GPU models you can buy close to MSPR. My goal is to update that article at least once per month, so be sure to check often.

## Best GPUs for 2026: Engadget ecommendations

### Entry-level (1080p)

As we mentioned above, if you're only aiming to play basic competitive shooters like _Valorant_ and _Overwatch 2_ in 1080p, an entry-level GPU may be all you need. While 1080p isn't an ideal resolution when it comes to sharpness, many gamers prefer it since it's easier to reach higher framerates. And it also helps that 1080p [gaming monitors](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html), like the AOC 24G15N 24-inch we recommend, tend to offer speedy refresh rates for between $100 and $200. When you're zipping through matches, you likely won't have time to take a breath and appreciate the detail from higher resolutions.

Here are our recommendations for entry-level video cards:

*   [AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 8GB](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0F8LDHQ7Y&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=AMD+Radeon+RX+9060+XT+8GB&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0dJR0FCWVRFLUdlRm9yY2UtV0lOREZPUkNFLUdyYXBoaWNzLUdWLU41MDYwV0YyT0MtOEdEL2RwL0IwRjhMREhRN1kvcmVmPXNyXzFfMTQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzY3NmY3MGUtODc3ZC00MjkzLWFmZTMtZmRiYzIxZTk4YzdjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0dJR0FCWVRFLUdlRm9yY2UtV0lOREZPUkNFLUdyYXBoaWNzLUdWLU41MDYwV0YyT0MtOEdEL2RwL0IwRjhMREhRN1kvcmVmPXNyXzFfMTQiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAASq7GUq7FIsSbjg9qw3xB3qr07qgnb4JH8nAMTI4Vlhn&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGIGABYTE-GeForce-WINDFORCE-Graphics-GV-N5060WF2OC-8GD%2Fdp%2FB0F8LDHQ7Y%2Fref%3Dsr_1_14): Surprisingly enough, you can actually find this AMD GPU for $300. While you'll have to live with 8GB of RAM, that's more than enough for 1080p gaming, and it also has the benefit of DLSS 4 upscaling.
    
*   [AMD Radeon RX 7600](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6ce976db-26d7-4094-a1be-4d1496b213f0&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Newegg&linkText=AMD+Radeon+RX+7600&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdlZ2cuY29tL2Fzcm9jay1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLXJ4NzYwMC1jbC04Z28tcmFkZW9uLXJ4LTc2MDAtOGdiLXZpZGVvLWNhcmQtZG91YmxlLWZhbnMvcC9OODJFMTY4MTQ5MzAwOTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc2NzZmNzBlLTg3N2QtNDI5My1hZmUzLWZkYmMyMWU5OGM3YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3ZWdnLmNvbS9hc3JvY2stY2hhbGxlbmdlci1yeDc2MDAtY2wtOGdvLXJhZGVvbi1yeC03NjAwLThnYi12aWRlby1jYXJkLWRvdWJsZS1mYW5zL3AvTjgyRTE2ODE0OTMwMDkzIn0&signature=AQAAAdk01Px_hFgy2FoOhn4aZiVa-tkYdugLT27Qfo26exEm&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasrock-challenger-rx7600-cl-8go-radeon-rx-7600-8gb-video-card-double-fans%2Fp%2FN82E16814930093): While it's a last-gen card, the RX 7600 is still powerful enough to handle basic shooters.
    

### Midrange (1440p)

While entry-level cards can dabble with 1440p gaming, it's worth stepping up to something a bit more powerful if you actually want to achieve higher refresh rates. For most gamers, 1440p is the best balance between sharpness and high frame rates. It looks noticeably better than 1080p, and doesn't require the horsepower overhead of 4K. (And there's a good chance you won't really see a visual difference with the jump to 4K.)

Here are our recommendations for midrange GPUs:

*   [NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Best+Buy&linkText=NVIDIA+RTX+5060+Ti&custData=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&signature=AQAAAXhuhQEnUA0P6BbI0o0aa_1a9CMuIbzXqw73Zyw-AQxF&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-windforce-16g-gddr7-pci-express-5-0-graphics-card-black%2F6629370.p%3FskuId%3D6629370): Forget the disappointing RTX 5070, the 5060 Ti delivers excellent 1080p and 1440p performance.

While you won't see the RX 9070 for its $550 launch price today, you can still snag one for a slight premium at $650.

### High-end (4K)

If you want the most of what modern PC games have to offer, including 4K and all of the benefits of ray tracing, then be ready to spend big bucks on a high-end GPU. If you're going this route, though, be sure you're also [gaming on a high-end monitor](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html) that befits these powerful GPUs.

Here are our recommendations for premium GPUs:

*   [NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DTGNB9Q5&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=NVIDIA+RTX+5070+Ti&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0dpZ2FieXRlLUdlRm9yY2UtV0lOREZPUkNFLUdyYXBoaWNzLUdWLU41MDdUV0YzT0MtMTZHRC9kcC9CMERUR05COVE1L3JlZj1zcl8xXzQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzY3NmY3MGUtODc3ZC00MjkzLWFmZTMtZmRiYzIxZTk4YzdjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0dpZ2FieXRlLUdlRm9yY2UtV0lOREZPUkNFLUdyYXBoaWNzLUdWLU41MDdUV0YzT0MtMTZHRC9kcC9CMERUR05COVE1L3JlZj1zcl8xXzQiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAfXSiql5nGCIz5gajDV3CH6kyl5Fb54A8VSLFIn4M4MC&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGigabyte-GeForce-WINDFORCE-Graphics-GV-N507TWF3OC-16GD%2Fdp%2FB0DTGNB9Q5%2Fref%3Dsr_1_4): The RTX 5070 Ti surprised me with excellent 4K gaming performance for a launch price that was well below the RTX 5080. It's the best overall NVIDIA card if you want to play in 4K at 120Hz or beyond, but it's also the hardest to find at MSRP. (Check out our [NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti review](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-5070-ti-review-a-sensible-4k-powerhouse-for-749-140023082.html).)
    
*   [AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/1password-adds-an-extra-layer-of-phishing-protection-140000293.html): I already mentioned the RX 9070 XT. With shortages of the 5070 Ti, it's the best GPU you can buy now without paying a ridiculous premium. (Check out our [AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT review](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-hitting-nvidia-where-it-hurts-140014376.html).)
    
*   [NVIDIA RTX 5080](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/1password-adds-an-extra-layer-of-phishing-protection-140000293.html): If the RTX 5070 Ti isn't enough for you, the RTX 5080's additional power and 24GB of VRAM should suit your fancy. Just be prepared to pay around $1,500 for it, a 50 percent jump from its $999 launch price.
