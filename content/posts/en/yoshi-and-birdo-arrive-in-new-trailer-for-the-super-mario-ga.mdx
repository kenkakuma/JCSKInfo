There's a new trailer for the upcoming Super Mario movie, _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_, and it confirms some beloved characters are joining the crew for its latest adventure. The trailer provides our first official look at Yoshi in the new movie, whose appearance was [leaked](https://mashable.com/article/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-pillsbury-leak) back in the fall by a Pillsbury cookie box design. And, just as exciting, we also see Birdo in the mix. The trailer was released during Nintendo's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct.

The short event also confirmed that the movie is now in post-production. While a [previous trailer](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-confirms-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-are-in-the-sequel-142815627.html) set the release date at April 3, the movie is now scheduled to come out two days earlier, on April 1. _The Super Mario Galaxy Movie_ stars Chris Pratt voicing Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach and Charlie Day as Luigi, along with Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), Benny Safdie (Bowser Jr.), Kevin Michael Richardson (Kamek) and Brie Larson (Rosalina).
