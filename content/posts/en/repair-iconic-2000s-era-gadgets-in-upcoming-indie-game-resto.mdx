We love a little nostalgia mixed in with our cozy gaming, and _ReStory_ looks like a perfect blend of those two. In this upcoming indie game, you play the owner of a Tokyo electronics repair shop in the mid 2000s. The trailer that dropped today shows you tinkering with some very familiar gadgets from the era, such as renamed riffs on a Tamagotchi, a Nokia brick phone, a PSP and a Walkman. You clean and repair these devices for customers, and it looks like your conversations with them might have as much impact on their lives as your official work does. 

The whole thing looks exceedingly charming and chill. It's nice to see a game like _ReStory_ as a counterpart to something with a similar premise but wildly different tone like _Kaizen_, which was a [highlight](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/neon-abyss-2-a-prison-break-rpg-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110043805.html) during the Steam Automation Fest over the summer. _ReStory_ is being developed by Mandragora, and it is currently [playtesting](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812600/ReStory_Chill_Electronic_Repairs/) ahead of a planned 2026 release.
