MTV [shut down](https://deadline.com/2025/12/mtv-off-air-video-killed-radio-star-1236659461/) its remaining 24/7 music channels in several countries, including the UK and Australia, at the end of 2025. The main MTV network shifted its focus to [reality shows](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-17-facebook-watch-the-real-world-mtv.html) long ago and it occasionally dips back into music with things like the Video Music Awards, but this shutdown felt like the end of an era. If you yearn for the days when MTV actually played music videos, though, you might be in luck. A developer who goes by the name of Flexasaurus Rex has paid tribute to the MTV of old with a web app that has several channels of non-stop streaming music. 

[MTV Rewind](https://wantmymtv.xyz/) has 11 channels at the time of writing, including one that features videos from the original channel’s first day of existence in 1981. There’s a channel dedicated to _MTV Unplugged_ performances, a rap-focused stream, one for each decade from the ‘70s to the ‘20s and (my personal faves) _120 Minutes_ and _Headbangers Ball_ options. MTV Rewind has so far pulled in more than 33,000 music videos. That’s over two months worth of music, as [_Loudwire_](https://loudwire.com/coder-built-mtv-rewind-videos-app/) notes.

"MTV was a cultural institution that changed music, fashion and youth culture. Then they stopped showing music videos and became reality TV,” Flexasaurus Rex [said](https://farcaster.xyz/flexasaurusrex/0x4820b097). “I felt a wave of sadness when the announcement hit. Nothing felt like it could fill that void. So I started coding. Built it in 48 hours: MTV Rewind."

Each channel plays videos in a random order and there’s a shuffle all option if you can’t decide which stream to watch. If a song isn’t hitting for you, just tap the skip button. There are some era-appropriate ads too. For instance, I hadn’t seen this one from the Got Milk? campaign before it popped up. It reminded me of the J. Walter Weatherman gag from _Arrested Development:_

The app’s database is powered by [IMVDb](https://imvdb.com/) (The Internet Music Video Database). The videos are all pulled from YouTube, one of the things that helped spell the demise of MTV’s 24/7 music channels. There wasn’t exactly a strong case for _Total Request Live_ to stay on the air, for instance, when we have access to practically every music video ever at our fingertips.  

One of my favorite things about MTV Rewind is that it has a hit counter like the Geocities of old. So very ‘90s. In fact, the whole thing is rad. Tubular, some might say. 

MTV Rewind isn’t associated with MTV or its parent company. However, it does use MTV’s name. Here’s hoping [Paramount’s](https://www.engadget.com/paramounts-strategy-of-purposeful-digital-rot-doesnt-even-make-sense-204613382.html) lawyers don’t crack down on this. It’s nice to have fun things on the internet.
