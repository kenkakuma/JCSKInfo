Look, [virtual private networks](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html) are great — I wouldn't have made a list of the [best VPNs](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html) if I didn't recommend using them. But being able to control your own technology is also important. A VPN can provide protection and peace of mind [when used properly](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html), but you may not want it active on your phone all the time.

For example: Are your Google search results suddenly in German? That’s one example of what can happen if you leave your virtual location set to Berlin or Vienna. Or maybe a VPN you installed for work or to watch a single tennis match is persistently trying to keep itself active.

The point is, deactivating a VPN on an iPhone can sometimes be unusually tricky, because there’s more than one off switch. Fortunately, it's not hard. There are several easy ways to disconnect from an iOS VPN or delete it entirely. If you catch it turning itself back on, I'll show you how to stop that too.

## **Three ways to turn off your iPhone VPN**

I'm using a fluid definition of "turn off" here. Some of the steps below simply disconnect the VPN, while others remove it from your phone altogether. I'll make it clear in each section what the outcome will be.

### **How to disconnect in the VPN app**

This is the easiest way to turn off a VPN on your iPhone. First, find the VPN app that’s active, which should be on your home screen somewhere. Each app has a different interface for connecting and disconnecting, but the disconnect button should be fairly obvious — it may say the word "disconnect" or show a green power icon. In any case, it should be right on the home screen, without requiring any digging through menus.

Tap the disconnect button and wait for the VPN to clearly state that it's disconnected. Check to make sure the rectangle with "VPN" inside has disappeared from the top of your iPhone screen. The VPN is now disconnected.

### **How to turn off the VPN in Settings**

If you aren't sure which VPN app is active, or if its interface doesn't make it clear how to turn it off, you can shut it down from the **Settings** menu instead. Find the app on your home screen that looks like several interlocking gray gears and tap it.

Next, scroll down and tap the **VPN** option. If it's not present (which it won’t be on older iOS versions), tap the **General** option next to another picture of a gray gear. Scroll down again and tap **VPN & Device Management** by yet another gray gear. Finally, tap the **VPN** option at the top of the screen to reach the VPN management page.

If you have a VPN active, you should see an option at the top of the page labeled **VPN Status**. Toggle it from Connected to Not Connected. The VPN icon should disappear from the top of your screen, indicating that it's turned off.

### **How to delete the VPN app altogether**

If you don't want the VPN on your phone at all, you can turn it off permanently by deleting both the app and the configuration. This is a lot harder to undo, so only do it if you're certain.

Start by deleting the app the same way you'd get rid of any other app. Tap the icon and hold until a pop-up menu appears. Select the **Remove App** option in red text, then click **Remove App** again when prompted.

Deleting the app should also delete the configuration, but you can verify this for yourself. Follow the process from the previous section to find the VPN settings page. If there's still a VPN profile in those settings, tap the circled letter "i" next to its name, then tap **Delete VPN** at the bottom of the screen. The VPN is now gone from your iPhone unless you re-download it from the App Store.

## **Troubleshooting: When an iPhone VPN turns itself back on**

Sometimes, even though you've followed all the steps, that pesky VPN rectangle is back on your screen the next time you unlock your phone. If your iOS VPN keeps turning itself back on, a few things might be happening, most of them thankfully fixable.

**If you did not delete the VPN,** it may be turning itself back on because its settings are telling it to. Go into its preferences menu and check for a setting called "auto-connect" or something similar. Settings like these have the VPN connect by itself to protect users who forget to activate it manually. Toggle all auto-connect options off and the problem should stop.

It's also possible that settings on the iOS side are making the VPN reconnect. Go to the VPN settings page (you'll find instructions for getting there in the previous section) and find the name of the active VPN profile. Tap the "i" next to it. On the next page, turn off "connect on demand" to stop the automatic reconnections.

**If you did delete the VPN,** but it's still reinstalling itself and turning back on, make sure that you deleted both the app and the connection profile. Reboot your iPhone to make sure all the settings stick. If the problem persists after all this, you've either got malware disguised as a VPN or you're using a school or work phone where the VPN can't be uninstalled.

If you aren't on a phone provided by a school or office, meaning you probably have malware, download an antivirus app and run a complete scan of your iPhone. This should remove any persistent files that keep reinstalling the virus. If, after all this, the VPN is _still_ turning itself back on, I recommend burning your phone in a salt circle with a bundle of sage.

## **When should you turn off your iPhone VPN?**

I encourage everyone to use a VPN every time they connect to the internet, but there are some situations where going through a VPN server is less convenient (this is the whole reason split tunneling exists). Here are a few cases in which temporarily turning off your VPN might be a good idea.

*   **The VPN isn't working.** If your browsing speed is sluggish or the VPN keeps dropping the connection, your VPN server might be having problems. Disconnecting and reconnecting, even in the same location, should switch you to a different server that may work better.
    
*   **The VPN is causing unintended browsing errors.** If you’re using mapping software or just trying to do a location-based search, having your VPN active can cause more problems than it solves.
    
*   **Your internet connection is unstable.** [A VPN adds an extra step](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html) to the process of getting online. If your phone is already struggling, the VPN might be an unnecessary complication.
    
*   **You're on a site that blocks all VPNs.** Sites that work based on your location, including all streaming sites, may blanket-block VPNs so nothing messes with their location services. Good VPNs can get around these blocks, but even the best sometimes fail. In these cases, briefly turning off the VPN may be a good idea.
    
*   **Your battery is low.** VPNs can put a strain on your phone's battery life. This varies with the quality of your VPN, but you may sometimes need to shut it off if your battery is in the red.
    

## **How to turn off iCloud Private Relay**

iCloud Private Relay is not a VPN, but it's often confused for one. If you found this page because you want to turn it off, you're in luck — the steps are just as simple as turning off a VPN. Start by opening **Settings**, then tap your name. Scroll down and tap **iCloud**.

Private Relay will only be active if you're an iCloud+ subscriber. If you are, tap **Private Relay**, then choose whether to turn it off temporarily or indefinitely.
