If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the _Today Show_ and _The Voice_, and for the second week in a row, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's _Sunday Night Football_ game, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. 

A [message released by Fubo to their customers](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/fubo-accuses-nbcuniversal-of-egregious-demands-amid-carriage-dispute-193515241.html) explains, "Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors." A [statement from an NBCU](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d7c5b935-7bd3-4149-94ef-aa50624bc67b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+New+York+Times&linkText=statement+from+an+NBCU&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hdGhsZXRpYy82ODI5NDM3LzIwMjUvMTEvMjIvZnViby1zdWJzY3JpYmVycy1uYmMtY2FycmlhZ2UtZGlzcHV0ZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3YzViOTM1LTdiZDMtNDE0OS05NGVmLWFhNTA2MjRiYzY3YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYXRobGV0aWMvNjgyOTQzNy8yMDI1LzExLzIyL2Z1Ym8tc3Vic2NyaWJlcnMtbmJjLWNhcnJpYWdlLWRpc3B1dGUvIn0&signature=AQAAAZiw0xn_ltwEXuiut0zUZ7PPCrh_JHLg4RkERRornX7q&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fathletic%2F6829437%2F2025%2F11%2F22%2Ffubo-subscribers-nbc-carriage-dispute%2F) spokesperson adds, "Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, [cut Warner-owned channels](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fubo-sports-streaming-platform-cuts-225312724.html) back in 2024.)

While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun issuing $15 credits to subscribers' bills as a gesture of goodwill, but if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them.

## **How to watch** **_Sunday Night Football_** **without Fubo**

## What else is on NBC this week?

In addition to this week's _Sunday Night Football_ game, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage, NBA and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like _Stumble_ and _The Voice_.

## Why are these NBC-owned channels currently unavailable?

[Per Fubo](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d7c5b935-7bd3-4149-94ef-aa50624bc67b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=FuboTV&linkText=Per+Fubo&custData=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&signature=AQAAATN5C9wq_BXOxQ_U6zvotQa-P_LuGX46zGAuhWKA-YTs&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.fubo.tv%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F38725620590733-What-Happened-to-NBCUniversal-Networks-on-Fubo%3Fproduct_category%3DArts%2B%2526%2BEntertainment%253EStreaming), NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved.

## When will the missing channels return?

There is no information available as to when NBC's lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing.

## Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing?

In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, "If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account." At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle.

## What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime?

Looking to switch from Fubo? You've got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices:

### **Watch NBC on Peacock**

### Get a deal on Peacock with Walmart+

### **Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month**

### **Try Hulu + Live TV for free**

## Other services to watch NBC

## If I switch to a different service, can I cancel or pause Fubo in the meantime?

Fubo does not allow customers to pause their subscriptions, so if you're looking to make a change, you can [cancel](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d7c5b935-7bd3-4149-94ef-aa50624bc67b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=FuboTV&linkText=cancel&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuZnViby50di9oYy9lbi11cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8zNjAwNDI1MzA0NzEtQ2FuLUktcGF1c2UtbXktRnViby1zdWJzY3JpcHRpb24iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3YzViOTM1LTdiZDMtNDE0OS05NGVmLWFhNTA2MjRiYzY3YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0LmZ1Ym8udHYvaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzYwMDQyNTMwNDcxLUNhbi1JLXBhdXNlLW15LUZ1Ym8tc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9uIn0&signature=AQAAAYdKHbXjBKAuco9tUmjnH71ky3CsMnux3Tni0HF-N6_O&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.fubo.tv%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360042530471-Can-I-pause-my-Fubo-subscription) your plan outright.
