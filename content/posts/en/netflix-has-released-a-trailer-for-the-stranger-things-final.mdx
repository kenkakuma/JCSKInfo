Tomorrow's the big day, and I don't just mean New Year's Eve. The series finale of _Stranger Things_ airs tomorrow, and Netflix has released a [trailer for the last episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQ13jsLDms). We're given only flashes of the final episode, along with a voiceover of an emotional Jim Hopper telling Eleven he needs her to fight one last time.

It's just over 1 minute and 30 seconds long, with what appears to be only about 30 seconds of new footage. There isn't much to go on here, as most of the footage features emotional moments from seasons past. Netflix no doubt is hoping to keep much of the excitement under wraps until tomorrow's premiere.

**Warning: Some spoilers ahead for** **_Stranger Things_** **season 5.**

Among the new images we briefly see Vecna, hooked up to the ceiling in his gross cave of power on his other world. There's also an explosion at what looks like a military site, plus a few more out-of-context flashes of our heroes.

One particularly ominous moment shows Hopper walking around a smoke-filled room with almost zero visibility, gun drawn, when we see what looks to be Vecna appear behind him. We also see Eleven climb back into the sensory-deprivation tank in the Upside Down, presumably to take the fight to the show’s big bad.

The only continuous scene in the trailer shows most of the gang standing atop a radio tower as Vecna's world moves close enough to collide with the tower's tip. Dustin lets out a "mother of God" as the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme the group cooked up in Chapter Seven appears to be well underway.

After nine years and five seasons, we will finally reach a conclusion for the heroes of Hawkins. The episode premieres at 8PM ET (5PM PT). For those still craving more from the world of Hawkins after the finale, Netflix is releasing a [Stranger Things animated series](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-trailer-for-the-animated-stranger-things-spin-off-is-here-172128527.html) in 2026.
