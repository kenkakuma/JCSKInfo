Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.

Under the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot [shared by](https://www.threads.com/@mattnavarra/post/DSXCACNirEt?xmt=AQF0RFIeIUKauwYgaXm8z0zs0jD3qmZqDZnvscsBxLvu0g) social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that "certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month."

Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test.

A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using "professional mode" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. "This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers," the spokesperson said.

While Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which [starts at](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/meta-verified-creators) $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.
