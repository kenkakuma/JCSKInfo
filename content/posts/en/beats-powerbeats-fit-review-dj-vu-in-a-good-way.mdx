Beats devices have been the more colorful, full-of-personality complements to Apple’s clean-and-minimal gear ever since Apple bought the company back in 2014. Beats earbuds and speakers are the more flexible alternatives to things like AirPods and HomePods, and the new [Beats Powerbeats Fit](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-announces-the-powerbeats-fit-a-slightly-updated-successor-to-the-beats-fit-pro-140000905.html) keep that tradition alive. Some six months after the [Powerbeats Pro 2](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review-apples-first-earbuds-with-heart-rate-tracking-150026710.html) debuted earlier this year, Beats now has an updated version of the Fit Pro to offer folks looking for many of the conveniences of an Apple device in something with slightly more character and versatility. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Beats made small changes on the Powerbeats Fit that ultimately make for a more polished version of its predecessor.

## What’s new

If you’re familiar with the [Beats Fit Pro](https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html), you’ll be familiar with the Powerbeats Fit. Beats kept much of what worked with its previous $200 earbuds here (including the price), making very minor changes to improve the comfort and the overall design. The new buds have 20 percent more flexible wingtips and the charging case is 17 percent more compact than that of the Beats Fit Pro. More on the wingtips in a moment, but first I have to commend Beats for making the charging case feel ever so slightly more premium this time around — and since it’s smaller than before, it’s less cumbersome to tuck in your back pocket. The buds also fit snugly into the charging case with a satisfying _snap_ every time; they always align properly to recharge, something I cannot say about past pairs of the AirPods Pro I’ve owned.

When it comes to the wingtips on the Powerbeats Fit, they appear to be a hair shorter than those on the Beats Fit Pro, and certainly more malleable. I felt the biggest difference in flexibility at the base of the wingtip where it meets the earbud — those on the Powerbeats Fit have a bit more give than those on its predecessor. These small changes make it easy to pop the Powerbeats Fit into your ears and really not fuss with the wingtips at all. They’re present just to provide a more secure fit during intense workouts, and they do just that.

I wore them during strength training, 5K runs and leisurely walks and I didn’t have to adjust them at all once I popped them in. When Beats announced these new buds, the company claimed its design tweaks would also make the Powerbeats Fit more comfortable to wear all day long, not just during workouts. I’ll admit that I didn’t find the previous Beats Fit Pro uncomfortable to wear when not at the gym or on the trail. Yes, the Powerbeats Fit are marginally more comfortable now and the wingtips are more supple, but the change is subtle. If you jibe with the wingtip design to begin with, you’ll safely be able to use the Powerbeats Fit as daily drivers in addition to workout companions.

Notably, the Powerbeats Fit come with one extra pair of eartips in the box (four instead of the previous three), so once you find the eartips that are your best fit, you’ll be off to the races. There are also two new bold colors to choose from, orange and pink, in addition to gray and black.

## What’s the same

Thankfully, Beats didn’t mess with all of the good things about the Fit Pro when developing the Powerbeats Fit. The new buds have an IPX4 water resistance rating, which isn’t the highest level of protection out there, but more than enough to withstand your sweatiest training sessions. Onboard controls in the form of physical buttons remain the same, although I didn’t accidentally trigger the buttons on the Powerbeats Fit nearly as much as I did with the Fit Pro. That might be because all the small changes Beats made in the design paid off — I didn’t fuss with the new buds in my ears as much as before, therefore I didn’t accidentally press the buttons as much.

The Powerbeats Fit also have Apple’s H1 chip inside, which enables features like hands-free Siri, automatic switching between devices, Adaptive EQ, Audio Sharing and Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. Transparency mode returns here as well, and it remains one of the standout features of any Apple-associated wireless earbuds. And if you do decide to wear the Powerbeats Fit all day long, you’ll likely make even more use of transparency mode as you need to jump in and out of conversations happening around you. In addition, you can keep track of the new earbuds in Apple’s Find My app.

Beats didn’t bill any improvements in sound quality on the Powerbeats Fit, and after listening to them alongside the Beats Fit Pro, I can say they sound almost identical. While listening to some tracks with the Powerbeats Fit, I noticed an almost imperceptible increase in the clarity of vocals, but that’s about it. Bass remains punchy and strong, and the buds get decently loud.

Active noise cancellation (ANC) is also the same on the new buds: strong enough to block out ambient noise around you and people’s voices. While running outside, I still heard the loudest disturbances like passing trucks and oddly sonorous cackling of nearby wildlife, but that’s arguably for the best. If you’re exercising outside, be it in a park or on city streets, you should be at least somewhat aware of your surroundings.

Battery life is consistent here as well, with Beats promising up to seven hours on a single charge (or six with ANC turned on) and up to 30 hours total when employing the Powerbeats Fit charging case. Anecdotally, after a week of using the Powerbeats Fit for an average of one hour each day, the charging case still had 75 percent battery left. If you’re using these all day, every day, you’ll obviously need to power it up more frequently. But if these are primarily your workout companions, you could get a week or two before needing to plug them in.

## Wrap-up

The latter was one of the best devices in the Beats lineup to begin with, and the latest model only improves upon the winning formula. They offer a solid balance of a comfortable, secure design, good sound quality and ANC and handy additional features at a decent price. The latter is arguably just as important as the buds’ ability to withstand a sweaty training session: folks looking for many of the conveniences found in AirPods will find them here in an alternative design, and in a pair of buds that also works just as well with Android devices. If you’re willing to pay more, you could shell out $250 for either the [Powerbeats Pro 2](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DT2LTRL7&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5c4eb8c8-5ae6-4965-bdfd-f3a38fb19c20&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Powerbeats+Pro+2&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0JlYXRzLVBvd2VyYmVhdHMtV2lyZWxlc3MtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUVhcmJ1ZHMvZHAvQjBEVDJMVFJMNy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWM0ZWI4YzgtNWFlNi00OTY1LWJkZmQtZjNhMzhmYjE5YzIwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0JlYXRzLVBvd2VyYmVhdHMtV2lyZWxlc3MtQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUVhcmJ1ZHMvZHAvQjBEVDJMVFJMNy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAXyR5xLdU8Ai3CKnl10ld8qARdEMKwNDOiT20LXXc7Ry&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeats-Powerbeats-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds%2Fdp%2FB0DT2LTRL7%2F) to get that full over-ear hook style, or [AirPods Pro 3](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0FQFB8FMG&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5c4eb8c8-5ae6-4965-bdfd-f3a38fb19c20&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=AirPods+Pro+3&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi1UcmFuc2xhdGlvbi1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUhpZ2gtRmlkZWxpdHkvZHAvQjBGUUZCOEZNRy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWM0ZWI4YzgtNWFlNi00OTY1LWJkZmQtZjNhMzhmYjE5YzIwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUNhbmNlbGxhdGlvbi1UcmFuc2xhdGlvbi1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUhpZ2gtRmlkZWxpdHkvZHAvQjBGUUZCOEZNRy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAe14ml4rOWYsTO3t_LyoSF9f7jKlcD2y0qab0sJgb2rG&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity%2Fdp%2FB0FQFB8FMG%2F) — both of which have built-in heart rate tracking But that feature in particular will be more of a nice-to-have than a necessity for most.
