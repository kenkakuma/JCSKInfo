Apple’s [in-house studio](https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-strange-planet-animated-series-222655000.html) will be producing the future seasons of _Severance_, according to [_Deadline_](https://deadline.com/2026/02/apple-acquires-severance-more-seasons-1236695148/). The company has reportedly acquired the show’s IP and all rights from its original studio, Fifth Season, back in December in a deal that was worth approximately $70 million. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer, but Apple Studios will now be in charge of the show. _Severance_ will be one of Apple’s marquee titles, alongside other shows like Owen Wilson’s _Stick_ and Kristen Wiig’s _Palm Royale_. Apple also previously acquired sci-fi dystopian series _Silo_ after its first season.

_Deadline_ reports that the show’s production costs were going beyond what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already asked Apple for advances in the past and was considering moving the production from New York to Canada for bigger tax rebates. Apple has also apparently been helping Fifth Season not just with its budget, but also with securing advertisers.

Seeing as the second season of _Severance_ became the streamer’s [most watched series](https://deadline.com/2025/02/severance-ratings-season-2-apple-most-watched-series-1236294760/), and Apple definitely has the money to keep the show going, the company decided to take over the series completely. It will allow _Severance’s_ production to stay in New York without having to worry about budget constraints. _Deadline_ says the series is expected to have four seasons, with the spinoffs showrunner Dan Erickson and director Ben Stiller are open to now being in the realm of possibility.
