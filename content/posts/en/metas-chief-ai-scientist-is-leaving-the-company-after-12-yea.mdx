One of Meta's top AI researchers, Yann LeCun, [is leaving](https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7I2jlco) after 12 years with the company to found his own AI startup, he announced. LeCun, who is also a professor at New York University, joined the company [in 2013](https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-09-facebook-hires-nyu-professor-to-lead-its-ai-efforts.html) to lead Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab and later took on the role of Chief AI Scientist. 

LeCun said his new startup would "continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond" and that it would partner with Meta. "The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences," he wrote in [an update](https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7_0DmDI) on Threads. "AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact."

Speculation about LeCun's future at Meta has been mounting in recent months. Earlier this year, the company invested nearly $15 billion into Scale AI and made the 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, its Chief AI Officer. Meta also recruited Shengjia Zhao, who helped create GPT-4, [making him](https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DMjD2LmSzyj/to-avoid-any-confusion-there-is-no-change-in-yanns-role-he-will-continue-to-be-c) Chief AI Scientist of its newly created Meta [Superintelligence Labs](https://www.engadget.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-confusing-vision-for-ai-superintelligence-153944322.html) unit. 

LeCun, on the other hand, has been openly skeptical of LLMs. "We are not going to get to human-level AI by just scaling LLMs," he said during [an appearance](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_a-new-podcast-with-alex-kantrowitz-activity-7308683959255613440-INPw/) on the Big technology podcast earlier this year. And in a recent talk at a conference, he advised aspiring researchers to "absolutely not work on LLMs," according to remarks [reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/yann-lecun-ai-meta-0058b13c) by _The Wall Street Journal._

At the same time, Meta has been reshuffling its AI teams. The company cut "several hundred" jobs from its Superintelligence group, including from FAIR, [last month](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/22/meta-superintelligence-tbd-ai-reorg). And LeCun has "had difficulty getting resources for his projects at Meta as the company focused more intently on building models to compete with immediate threats from rivals including OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Anthropic," _Bloomberg_ [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-19/meta-ai-s-lecun-to-announce-exit-startup-as-soon-as-this-week). 

LeCun said he will stay on at Meta until the end of the year. "I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth (Boz), Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years," he wrote.
