Sony and Polyphony Digital are rolling out a huge update for [_Gran Turismo 7_](https://www.engadget.com/gran-tourismo-7s-more-realistic-physics-update-is-launching-cars-into-orbit-120045578.html) on December 4 in the form of a paid add-on. The [Power Pack DLC](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc-coming-december-4/) for the PlayStation 5 will unlock 50 new races across 20 theme categories, including 24-hour endurance events that Le Mans fans could sink their teeth into. In previous games, the endurance events really took 24 hours to finish, though you could pause and, eventually, save mid-race, allowing you to pick up where you left off. You can also experience full-race seasons, from practicing for them to qualifying for the main events.

The DLC includes access to Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0, as well, which Sony says will provide “realistic AI behavior” and enable “intense, tail-to-nose battles that push your limits.” [Sophy 2.0](https://www.engadget.com/sony-gt-sophy-racing-ai-gran-turismo-7-ps5-130057992.html) was launched as an update back in 2023, offering you “a stimulating opponent that can accelerate and elevate \[your\] techniques and creativity to the next level.” Finally, the DLC will give you 5 million in in-game Credits. The companies have yet to reveal how much the Power Pack DLC will cost, but it will be available for download from the PlayStation Store.

> Play through full sessions from practice to qualifying to the race, and go tail-to-nose with GT Sophy 3.0!  
>   
> The Power Pack DLC adds 50 new races like 24H endurance and comes with 5M in-game credits. Coming 4 December!
