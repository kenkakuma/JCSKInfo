I’m no psychologist, but I get a sense Segway turned up to CES 2026 with something to prove after last year. Certainly, it’s gone out of its way to prove its micromobility bona fides with the press, who perhaps were a bit too sniffy that [scooter people were launching an e-bike.](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-is-finally-launching-e-bikes-at-ces-2025-130015667.html) This year, Segway’s not just launching two more mainstream e-bikes, but an electric dirt bike, all of which are crammed with the sort of tech that might just make everyone halt their sniffiness.

First up, there’s the Myon, a chunky step-through with a decent-sized pannier rack for folks who want to go far and carry a bit of luggage as they go. That’s hardly an eye-catching proposition given so many e-bikes fit within the same template, but Segway is hoping its tech will make a difference here. Myon is equipped with electronic gear shifting (tied to a Shimano CUES chain drivetrain), electronic motor optimization and the company’s proprietary Intelligent Ride System. 

The latter, along with Segway(TM) TurboTuned(TM) will automatically optimize motor and battery performance while under way. The company adds that the bike’s built-in gyros, cadence and torque sensors will meter out performance according to road conditions. So if you’re going up hill, the power will gently increase before you have to think about it. Additionally, if you stop at the lights, the system won’t just turn on the power to whatever you’ve set it at as soon as it senses the tiniest ounce of pressure on the pedal, removing the jerky start action you see in other bikes.

Segway’s broader pitch is that its bikes will also feature a whole host of smart features, including integration with Apple’s Find My network, GPS tracking, remote locking, integration with your health and fitness app of choice, and smartphone pairing.

Muxi

Segway

Muxi (pronounced _moo-shee_) is a more interesting piece of hardware, since it’s been built like a longtail cargo bike, but with the long tail chopped off. Even so, the focus is on cargo, with the bike getting an optional passenger seat with foot pegs, and an optional middle basket. Plus, the bike comes with a beverage cup holder (although given it has a direct drive motor, I’m not sure I’d want to cruise around at low speed while trying to sip my morning latte). To ensure you don’t struggle with your load, the bike comes with Hill Start Assist, Hill Descent Control, regenerative braking and traction control. Plus the aforementioned suite of added value features, like Find My integration, remote locking, GPS and the app integrations. 

Rounding out the announcements is the Xaber (_say-br_) 300, an electric dirt bike geared toward off-roading. It has three power modes, letting you learn on the equivalent of a 150cc engine, then dialing that up to 200cc, before topping out at 300cc. If you still want a greater sense of control, you can activate an electronic clutch, and if you want to cede more of it to the bike, you can set the maximum wheelie angle. If you want to enjoy all of that dirt bikin’ action, it’ll set you back $5,300 when it arrives.

As for Myon, it’s available to buy today from Segway’s official site and via its dealer network, priced at $2,000. Muxi will be available through those same channels in March, setting you back $1,700.
