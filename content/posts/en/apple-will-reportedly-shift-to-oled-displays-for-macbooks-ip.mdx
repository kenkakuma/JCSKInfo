Apple is planning to introduce OLED displays to its [iPad Air](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-air-m3-review-a-modest-update-thats-still-easy-to-recommend-130045196.html), [iPad mini](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html) and [MacBook Air](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html) devices, _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/apple-plans-oled-for-ipad-mini-ipad-air-macbook-air-mini-water-resistance). The technology offers deeper blacks and better contrast than the LCDs currently used on those devices, which would make them better for things like content creation and entertainment. However, OLED is also more expensive, so it could result in higher prices on future models.

The company is currently testing versions of each product with OLED screens, according to people familiar with the matter. That display tech is usually reserved for higher-end PCs and tablets — right now, Apple only uses OLED screens in its iPad Pro lineup (apart from iPhones). However, it may be looking to boost flagging sales of Mac and iPad products, with OLED displays offering buyers a good reason to upgrade.

The first device to gain the tech will probably be the iPad mini that may launch next year, according to Gurman's sources. The OLED version, code-named J510, may cost up to $100 more thanks to the new display and an updated water-resistant design. The iPad Air and MacBook Air will follow later on, possibly in 2028 in the case of the latter. 

Earlier this month, both Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo [predicted](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-m6-macbook-pro-generation-will-reportedly-offer-touchscreens-203029809.html) that Apple would release a MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen in late 2026 or early 2027 — despite the fact that Steve Jobs famously hated touchscreens. It's not clear if the MacBook Air with OLED would also have a touch display. 

On top of the contrast and black level advantages, OLED displays are lighter than LCDs as they don't require a backlight. The main drawback is a lack of brightness. Apple's current MacBook Pros use MiniLED tech that does offer higher brightness levels, but has inferior contrast compared to OLED. Take these rumors with a grain of salt, of course, and even if they're accurate, Apple's plans may change.
