IO Interactive's James Bond simulator _007 First Light_ has been [delayed until May 27, 2026](https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016). It was supposed to come out in March. The company says two-month delay is for polish and refinement, which is fine by me. I'd always rather wait a bit longer for a better end product.

IO says the game is already "fully playable from beginning to end" but still needs a bit of attention to ensure "the strongest possible version at launch." The developer promises to share more updates at the beginning of next year.

For the uninitiated, _007 First Light_ is the first James Bond game [in over a decade](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/007-first-light-hitman-meets-action-movie-183551755.html). The developer is the same organization behind the renowned Hitman franchise, so this could potentially be the best Bond game since _Goldeneye_.

The gameplay looks fast-paced, frenetic and filled with spycraft. It features an original story that pulls from all over the decades-long franchise. We got a chance to speak to [narrative director Martin Emborg](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html) and he noted that the game stars a young and inexperienced Bond, which seems to be the direction Amazon is taking [with its upcoming film](https://www.nme.com/news/film/new-james-bond-will-be-very-young-as-amazon-reportedly-plans-retro-reboot-3851305).

The game also boasts a pretty stacked cast. Patrick Gibson, from _The OA_ and _Dexter: Original Sin_, plays the famous lothario spy and Lenny Kravitz has been cast as the primary villain. Other cast members include Lennie James, Kiera Lester, Alastair Mackenzie and Priyanga Burford.

Who knows when the next Bond film will actually come out, so this should be a nice little stopgap for fans.
