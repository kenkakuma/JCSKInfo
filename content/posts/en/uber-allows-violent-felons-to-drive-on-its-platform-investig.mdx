Uber outright rejects applicants convicted of murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and terrorism. However, in 22 states, the _Times_ found Uber can approve applicants convicted of many other offenses including child abuse, assault and stalking, if the convictions are at least seven years old. The extensive investigation also found that in 35 states, these checks are based largely on where someone has lived in those seven years, meaning convictions from other locations could be missed.

In 2017, Massachusetts conducted an audit of ride-hailing drivers in the state and ended up banning more than 8,000 drivers (about 11 percent) who were previously approved. Lyft, for its part, does not allow drivers with previous violent felony convictions regardless of how long ago the conviction was.

In a document from 2015 reviewed by the Times, Uber executives discussed a strategy to "shift the conversation about safety from background checks to \[less costly\] initiatives proven to reduce incidents." A 2018 email from Uber’s then head of safety communications described the company's background check policy as "a bare minimum."

The Times compiled half a dozen examples of serious cases where Uber drivers with past violent convictions were later accused by passengers of sexual assault or rape. Two of those cases resulted in criminal convictions.

Between 2017 and 2022, Uber's US operations [received a report](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5f49c81d-f1e7-4989-98c4-a5737806376b&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+New+York+Times&linkText=received+a+report&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA4LzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL3ViZXItc2V4dWFsLWFzc2F1bHQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWY0OWM4MWQtZjFlNy00OTg5LTk4YzQtYTU3Mzc4MDYzNzZiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzA4LzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL3ViZXItc2V4dWFsLWFzc2F1bHQuaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAATHPzWmh6SXQhCm5z0t5mG52sBx7EbUDQ_XYNVzsTlP6&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F08%2F06%2Fbusiness%2Fuber-sexual-assault.html) of sexual assault or sexual misconduct among almost every eight minutes, according to the company's own internal data. Uber said 75 percent of these reports were for "less serious" incidents such as flirting or making comments about a rider's appearance, and claimed that 99.9 percent of its rides take place without incident.
