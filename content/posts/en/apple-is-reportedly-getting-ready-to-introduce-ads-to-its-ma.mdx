Opening Apple's [Maps app](https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-use-its-street-view-maps-photos-to-train-ai-models-150919972.html) just for directions may look a little different in the near future. According to [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-26/what-s-next-for-the-ipad-pro-iphone-17-pro-like-vapor-chamber-apple-maps-ads-mh7nq39h)'s Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to introduce ads to Maps as soon as next year. While it won't be as annoying as unskippable YouTube ads, Apple wants to offer better visibility on Maps to restaurants and businesses that are willing to pay.

When looking for a new restaurant or relevant business, you may already be used to seeing ads on Google Maps or Yelp that highlight certain establishments. However, Gurman said that Apple is planning to lean on AI for better search results and offer a better interface than Google Maps. The introduction of ads across Apple's iOS ecosystem shouldn't be surprising since Gurman [previously reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg) Apple's interest back in 2022. On top of that, Apple already offers ad slots within the [App Store](https://www.engadget.com/apples-app-store-today-homepage-tab-will-soon-feature-ads-084133344.html) where developers can pay to appear in a more visible position for user searches. Beyond Maps, Apple could be looking at infusing ads into its News, Books, Podcasts and other apps to generate more revenue.
