Elon Musk told Joe Rogan on his podcast he hopes to [unveil a flying car](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/elon-musk-teases-a-flying-car-on-joe-rogans-show-120022824.html) “before the end of the year.” It was an interesting announcement to make, as Rogan also asked Musk about the long-delayed second-gen Tesla Roadster. Tesla unveiled a new Roadster in 2017 and had plans to start deliveries in 2020, but production was delayed several times.

Avoiding _that_ conversation, the Tesla CEO suddenly started talking about wanting the vehicle to fly. After vague answers and musing, he eventually said: “My friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don’t have flying cars.”

He claimed the vehicle Tesla is supposedly working on contains “crazy, crazy technology.” Musk said he wasn’t sure it’s technically a car but that “it looks like a car.”

Musk has been talking about flying cars since 2014. Given his optimistic take on development timelines, that’s a good 10 years of talk so far. Give it perhaps another 10?

Creator Mel Bouzad is suing Meta for over $115,000 on his and other creators’ behalf. He alleges that Meta’s broken AI and vague “monetization policy violations” led to the wrongful demonetization of high-earning pages and the withholding of tens of thousands of dollars in payments. Can multiple small claims court fights force Meta to provide human support and fix its system? Read the full story on the volatile world of viral content.

### SpaceX could build up to 600 satellites for a new defense system.

SpaceX will reportedly receive a $2 billion contract to develop satellites for the US government, according to sources talking to _The Wall Street Journal_. SpaceX will reportedly be tasked with developing up to 600 satellites that can track missiles and aircraft and will be used for President Trump’s proposed Golden Dome project.

The president introduced the project earlier this year as an anti-missile defense system, designed to intercept missile attacks before they reach their target.

Apple surprised many by announcing an upgraded Vision Pro with its latest M5 chip. It’s still largely the same device. The revamped Apple Vision Pro is faster and more comfortable than the original, but its limited ecosystem still makes it better suited to developers than consumers.

It does support PSVR2 controllers, though.
