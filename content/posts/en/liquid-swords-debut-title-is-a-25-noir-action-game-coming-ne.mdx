The debut game from Liquid Swords will arrive in early 2026, it was announced at today's PC Gaming Show. _Samson: A Tyndalston Story_ is billed as "a consequence-heavy noir action game" by its developer, and focuses on the eponymous Samson McCray, a man who's got himself into serious debt in a city that doesn’t seem particularly forgiving. 

The debut trailer doesn’t give too much away in terms of story, but I’m getting gritty Max Payne-y vibes. Combat looks crunchy and visceral, and it sounds like Liquid Swords is going for an oppressive atmosphere. "Samson is built on a simple, brutal truth: every day costs you," writes the studio in a press release. "Debt grows with interest, and time works against you. Each job burns a limited pool of Action Points and every decision shifts how the city treats you—there are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse."

Liquid Swords has been [teasing](https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067?s=20) its first game for a while. The studio has some serious pedigree, being founded in 2020 by Christopher Sundberg, who created the Just Cause franchise when he was at Avalanche Studios. Developers who previously worked on _Mad Max_ and the Battlefield series have also joined Sundberg at Liquid Swords, and the studio says it drew on its collective experience in combat systems, systemic design, animation and action-oriented storytelling to create _Samson_.

Just Cause was an open-world series, but it sounds like _Samson_ will be a more focused experience, possibly reflected by its $25 price tag. At the beginning of the year, the studio [laid off](https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges) an undisclosed number of employees, something it said was necessary to ensure its “long-term sustainability” amid challenging industry conditions. _Samson: A Tyndalston Story_ launches in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store. We don't yet know if it's coming to console as well.
