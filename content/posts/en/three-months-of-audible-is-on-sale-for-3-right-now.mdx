Have a hankering for some audiobooks? Audible is holding one heck of a sale right now, giving users [three months of access for $3](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=a8d99938-0b9f-4c17-b1d6-b88b320bc1cc&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=three+months+of+access+for+%243&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0F1ZGlibGUtQm9va3MtYW5kLU9yaWdpbmFscy9iP25vZGU9MTgxNDUyODkwMTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYThkOTk5MzgtMGI5Zi00YzE3LWIxZDYtYjg4YjMyMGJjMWNjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0F1ZGlibGUtQm9va3MtYW5kLU9yaWdpbmFscy9iP25vZGU9MTgxNDUyODkwMTEiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAczOm3_IdC_-0kKi-eMjOdMSm6ArP56g69HCYr4iRiZy&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudible-Books-and-Originals%2Fb%3Fnode%3D18145289011). That's a dollar per month. This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21.

An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything.

However, it's easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.

In other words, it's a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren't enjoying the platform.
