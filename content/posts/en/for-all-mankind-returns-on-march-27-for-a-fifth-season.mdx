Apple TV+ has become one of the best streaming services for sci-fi, with hits like _Pluribus_, _Severance_, _Foundation_ and many more. There are so many shows that it's easy to forget the one that started it all. _For All Mankind_ was the platform's very first attempt at sci-fi and it's finally coming back after two years for season five on March 27.

The next season will run for ten episodes on a weekly basis. It concludes on May 29, with new installments dropping each Friday.

What follows are some slight spoilers for the show, so read with caution. The streamer [dropped a short teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tso9D9jc) to announce the release date and it shows Alex Baldwin, grandson of the show's original star, careening around Mars on some sort of motorcycle.

_For All Mankind_ started as an alt-history show that explored what would happen if Russia beat the USA to the moon in the 1960s. However, it has since become famous for time jumps. The next installment takes place in an alternate version of the 2010s and continues the story of competing space agencies after turning Mars into a viable colony.

Many of the original stars are still kicking around, but the characters are extremely old at this point.

Other returning cast members include Edi Gathegi, Coral Peña and Wrenn Schmidt. New cast members include Sean Kaufman, Mireille Enos, Costa Ronin, Ruby Cruz and Ines Asserson.

The show doesn't get a lot of buzz when compared to some of Apple TV's newer sci-fi properties, but it must still get eyeballs. The platform [recently announced a spinoff](https://www.engadget.com/apple-renews-for-all-mankind-and-announces-a-spinoff-series-set-in-the-soviet-union-173950761.html) that will be set in the Soviet Union. It's called [_Star City_](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=870143af-89dd-46a8-84c5-50a4ab938082&featureId=text-link&linkText=Star+City&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R2LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uei9zaG93L3N0YXItY2l0eS91bWMuY21jLjJsOHA3ODVvc210bWl5azY0Ymg2dGZkZTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg3MDE0M2FmLTg5ZGQtNDZhOC04NGM1LTUwYTRhYjkzODA4MiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90di5hcHBsZS5jb20vbnovc2hvdy9zdGFyLWNpdHkvdW1jLmNtYy4ybDhwNzg1b3NtdG1peWs2NGJoNnRmZGUxIn0&signature=AQAAAe7vjdKQjLSf6oW6N-iZrJ63QcUZ2ziRjs6NuGxI9rdI&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftv.apple.com%2Fnz%2Fshow%2Fstar-city%2Fumc.cmc.2l8p785osmtmiyk64bh6tfde1) but we don't have much information beyond that.
