Store pages on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528) are looking a lot less cramped thanks to a new update. Pages have been made wider, with support for higher resolution images and new viewing modes for trailers and screenshots. You'll notice changes in the top carousel and in the "About the Game" section, where some new formatting options should make things look a bit more organized. The update just rolled out to the public after first being tested among beta users.

With this update, pages have been widened to 1200 pixels, which Valve says "felt like a good balance where we can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page and making it hard to navigate." There's now the option of a large pop-up view called theater mode in the carousel, as well as full-screen mode. In addition to games' store pages, Valve has slightly tweaked the appearance of search results and recommendation pages to be wider, and made store hubs, Steam Charts and the News Hub look more uniform.

You may also notice some more colorful backgrounds on games' store pages and in bundle detail pages. Where you _won't_ see changes yet, though, is the homepage. While Valve says it's working on "similar adjustments" for the homepage, those aren't rolling out with this update.
