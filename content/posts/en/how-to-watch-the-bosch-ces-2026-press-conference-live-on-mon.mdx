You might recognize Bosch as a home appliance name (thanks to its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational brand's core business is really about providing the underlying technology and engineering that powers cars, homes and factories around the world. That focus is reflected at [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000369.html), where much of what Bosch is unveiling is intended to be licensed to other companies rather than sold as Bosch-branded products on store shelves.

Case in point is Bosch's automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls "AI in the car," or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. "Bosch's AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants," Bosch board member Markus Heyn [said in a press release](https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ai-in-the-car-bosch-presents-cockpit-innovations-at-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-280272.html). We'll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.

## How to watch Bosch's CES 2026 presentation

You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the [Bosch press page](https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/ces-2026-livestream.html) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzDeUHM8eik). (We've embedded the stream link below.)

## What to expect

Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its [three big themes](https://www.bosch.com/stories/ces-2026/#what-to-expect) — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.

Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car's system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it's noting that NVIDIA's software suites will help manage "real-time sensor processing and vision-language models."

Here's a glimpse of what the booth will look like:
