They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing.

Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our [AirPods Pro 3 review](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html) for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular.

The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls.

Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced.

Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic.

There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the [best wireless earbuds](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html) for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the [AirPods 4 with ANC](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DGJ7HYG1&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=0a0f2486-773a-4f32-a569-99ec360cccc9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=AirPods+4+with+ANC&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwREdKN0hZRzEvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhMGYyNDg2LTc3M2EtNGYzMi1hNTY5LTk5ZWMzNjBjY2NjOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMERHSjdIWUcxLyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAAYkumGySoSgGbE9CWPvjkbgc26n4hs06u2ZYkGcqH2KM&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ7HYG1%2F) are on sale for $100 right now as well, and the standard [AirPods 4](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0DGHMNQ5Z&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=0a0f2486-773a-4f32-a569-99ec360cccc9&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=AirPods+4&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwREdITU5RNVovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBhMGYyNDg2LTc3M2EtNGYzMi1hNTY5LTk5ZWMzNjBjY2NjOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMERHSE1OUTVaLyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAAdPyd5J77NexcJPQ-1Kpc86Qhn8mz6P3_pgoveODZwto&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHMNQ5Z%2F) are down to $69.
