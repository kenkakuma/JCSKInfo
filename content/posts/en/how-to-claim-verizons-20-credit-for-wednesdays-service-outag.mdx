Verizon is offering a very small _mea culpa_ after [Wednesday's massive outage](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/verizon-says-its-service-is-back-after-a-10-hour-outage-183048229.html), which drew more than 1.5 million reports on [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/) and lasted hours. The carrier [posted on X](https://x.com/verizonnews/status/2011820123154182420?s=61&t=a-bloX1n-TZ50ofqhetO1A) that it will offer a $20 credit, but customers must redeem it in the myVerizon app.

"This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can," the company wrote. "But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us." Incensed customers have largely replied with incredulity, both at the miniscule amount, and that it isn't being applied automatically.

Engadget has reached out to Verizon seeking clarity on whether this credit can be claimed by contacting the carrier or only through the app. We will update this piece if we hear back.

**Update, January 15 2026, 11:57 PM ET:** Verizon says the credit can be claimed through customer service via phone, chat and online in addition to the myVerizon app.
