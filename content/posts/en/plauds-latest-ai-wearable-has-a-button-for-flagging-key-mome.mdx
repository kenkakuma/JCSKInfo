Plaud is back with another conversation-recording AI wearable. This one, the NotePin S, is only a minor iteration on [the original NotePin](https://www.engadget.com/ai/watch-out-theres-a-new-ai-pin-in-town-that-can-transcribe-all-your-conversations-153131281.html). This model adds… a button.

The recessed recording button replaces the squeeze-to-record mechanism on the 2024 original. A single long press starts recording. It also adds a new "press to highlight" feature. The idea is to flag what's most important in a conversation, helping the AI learn what to emphasize in its summary.

Otherwise, you're getting the same package as in the first NotePin. The capsule-sized "S" model still has two microphones, weighs 0.6 ounces and has an advertised reliable recording range of 9.8 feet. (Students may want to keep that last point in mind before considering one for classes in lecture halls.) It includes hardware to set it up as a pin / lapel, lanyard, wristband or clip.

The NotePin S is available today for $179. You can order it from Plaud's website and Amazon. Just be sure to look out for your fellow humans and get their consent before recording them, okay?
