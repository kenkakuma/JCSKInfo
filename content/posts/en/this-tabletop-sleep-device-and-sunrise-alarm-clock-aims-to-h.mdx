"Relaxing" isn't a word anyone is likely to associate with CES. If anything, it is the antithesis of CES, an exhausting and wildly overstimulating marathon event that takes place in the already exhausting and wildly overstimulating Las Vegas. But a demo of Ambient's bedside device, Dreamie, ahead of its appearance at CES-adjacent Pepcom had me properly lulled and ready to go right back to bed. Dreamie is a smart sunrise alarm clock and nighttime wind-down device that has a built-in podcast player, a catalog of green, pink and brown noise sound masks, guided breathing programs, contactless motion sensors to provide insights into your sleep habits, dynamic lighting with simulated sunrise wake-ups and Bluetooth connectivity for headphones.

But most importantly for anyone trying to avoid using their phone immediately before bed, it's a standalone system in which all controls, features and scheduling options as well as data storage are on-device. And there's no subscription. 

The goal of Dreamie is "to help you separate from your phone while providing a lot of the conveniences that you would normally have," said CEO and co-founder Adrian Canoso. You can set multiple alarms on different schedules, access soothing content to fall asleep to and customize how gradual your sunrise wakeup is. There are environmental sensors to clue you in on the humidity, temperature and lighting conditions over the course of the night, to give you a better idea of how these things may be affecting your sleep. 

Dreamie is a relatively small device compared to [other sunrise-style clocks](https://www.engadget.com/hatch-restore-2-review-better-sleep-behind-a-paywall-130028052.html), with a truncated pill-shaped body and a sleek circular touchscreen. Around the display is a hidden dial for volume control, and it feels great to rotate, with just the right amount of resistance. There's also a touch strip on top of the device to easily adjust the dimness of the light by dragging your finger along it. From the display, you can even change the direction the light is pointing so you don't blast yourself (or your partner) with it when your eyes aren't ready, casting the light off to the back instead.

Dreamie's brightness controls

Its 20-LED array can go from a soft, warm orangey glow to cool and bright blue-white, and certain programs, like the aurora borealis soundscape, will trigger other colors of the rainbow, throwing soothing green, blue and magenta. More impressive is the rich sound that comes from its 50 millimeter speaker. Dreamie has a 360-degree speaker grille on the bottom of the device that sends sound in all directions to create more immersive ambient sound. 

When a speaker is pointing toward you, "it's almost like a laser beam coming at you," which isn't exactly the most relaxing experience, explained Canoso, who previously worked in industrial design and robotics, and before that, as a studio recording engineer. "\[Dreamie\] projects the sound all the way around… So when you put it next to you on a night table, it sounds more diffused. It's not the loudest speaker out there because we've optimized it for rich sound quality at lower volumes. We don't need it loud. We just need it to sound good." 

And sound good, it does. It's seriously got me thinking I may finally have found the thing to replace the [Philips Wake-Up Light](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B075S53HD9&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=e95a8f19-9e7b-4662-8bf7-4679e03ced4a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Philips+Wake-Up+Light&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BoaWxpcHMtV2FrZS11cC1UaGVyYXB5LUhGMzY1MC02MC9kcC9CMDc1UzUzSEQ5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU5NWE4ZjE5LTllN2ItNDY2Mi04YmY3LTQ2NzllMDNjZWQ0YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLVdha2UtdXAtVGhlcmFweS1IRjM2NTAtNjAvZHAvQjA3NVM1M0hEOSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&signature=AQAAAc6CbLMYoj0gzVpGqYP4kP6acGcPHI7NVmyQeUhtJBQE&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Wake-up-Therapy-HF3650-60%2Fdp%2FB075S53HD9) I've been clinging to for close to 10 years now that has decent lighting but absolutely abysmal sound quality.

Dreamie, which costs $250, recently started shipping after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and certain features — including podcasts and sleep insights — haven't launched just yet (though I did get to see the podcast library during the demonstration, so it is a real thing, and it’s expected to roll out later this month). Those and other future features will arrive via free over-the-air updates.
