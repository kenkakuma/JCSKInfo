Marshall plans to add seamless multi-room audio to its Bluetooth speakers via a newly announced music streaming hub called [Heddon](https://www.marshall.com/us/en/product/heddon?pid=1009160). The $300 hub makes it possible to connect and synchronize multiple older Marshall speakers together, not unlike Sonos' audio devices.

Rather than use Wi-Fi to get multiple speakers playing the same audio, though, the Marshall Heddon uses [Auracast](https://www.engadget.com/bluetooth-auracast-is-everywhere-at-ces-2024-so-what-is-it-224509414.html). The hub connects to services like Spotify Connect or Tidal over Wi-Fi, or other devices through Google Cast and AirPlay, and then shares that audio over Auracast to the [Marshall Acton III, Stanmore III and Wobrun III speakers](https://www.engadget.com/marshall-home-speakers-acton-stockton-woburn-iii-lineup-wide-soundstage-hdmi-140038655.html). You can control playback over a connected Marshall app and the Heddon also has RCA ports to connect other speakers or a record player to the system.

Because the Heddon requires a Wi-Fi connection, Marshall says it could add features to the system over-time, but even in the short term, the hub should meaningfully extend the life of the company's speakers. Rather than switch to newer models with built-in Wi-Fi, you can just grab a Heddon. Sonos offers similar functionality through its [Sonos Port](https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-sonos-one-sl-port.html) and [Sonos Amp](https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-sonos-amp-streaming-av-hub.html) accessories, and third-party hubs from companies like [WiiM](https://www.wiimhome.com/index) can add even more options. The Marshall Heddon is more streamlined in comparison, but if you're already invested in the company's speakers, or planning to build out your audio system with them, the hub could be a helpful tool to have.

The Marshall Heddon is available to purchase now for $300. Marshall says that customers purchasing an Acton III, Stanmore III or Woburn III can get a Heddon at half price, and the hub is included for free when you buy two or more eligible Marshall home speakers.
