**Mobile App Metrics Signal Plateau**

Analysis from mobile app intelligence firm Apptopia shows ChatGPT's mobile application growth has decelerated significantly since April. The most striking indicators come from user engagement metrics: average time spent per daily active user in the United States has plummeted 22.5% since July, while average sessions per user have dropped 20.7%.​

Global download growth has also stalled, with October 2025 on pace to show an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new installations. While ChatGPT continues attracting millions of daily downloads and remains the most downloaded app for seven consecutive months, the rate of new user acquisition has markedly slowed.​

"The experimentation phase with the ChatGPT app may be over, and now it's becoming a part of users' daily routines," according to Apptopia's assessment. Users appear to be engaging with the app more selectively, "when they need it or remember to use it," rather than with the heightened usage seen during its initial novelty period.​

**Subscription Growth Stagnates in Europe**

The engagement concerns extend beyond mobile metrics. Deutsche Bank Research Institute data reveals that European consumer spending on ChatGPT subscriptions has flatlined since May 2025. This stagnation occurred despite ChatGPT reaching 800 million weekly active users globally, as announced by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.​

The subscription plateau is particularly concerning given OpenAI's massive infrastructure commitments, including a $500 billion deal with Broadcom and previous commitments totaling $1 trillion with Nvidia, AMD, and Oracle.​

"The poster child for the AI boom may be struggling to recruit new subscribers to pay for it," Deutsche Bank analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan noted. With only approximately 20 million paying subscribers among 800 million weekly users, OpenAI faces the challenge of converting its massive user base into sustained revenue.​

**Competition and Model Changes Drive Decline**

Several factors may explain the deceleration. Increased competition from Google's Gemini, which surged to prominence in September with new AI features, has intensified pressure on ChatGPT. Additionally, OpenAI's own updates may have contributed to reduced engagement, including April changes designed to make the chatbot less accommodating and August's GPT-5 release, which was described as "less personable".​

However, Apptopia notes the decline in engagement metrics predated Gemini's rise, suggesting deeper structural changes in user behavior rather than purely competitive pressures.​

For OpenAI, these trends signal a need for renewed investment in app marketing and new feature development to revive growth metrics, similar to strategies employed by other established mobile applications that can no longer rely solely on novelty for expansion.​
