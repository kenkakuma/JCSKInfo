[OnlyFans](https://www.engadget.com/only-fans-temporarily-halts-services-for-russian-creators-234834046.html) is looking to cash out once again, but this time in a deal that would value it at several billion dollars less than a potential sale that previously fell through. As reported by [_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/onlyfans-considering-selling-majority-stake-to-architect-capital/)_,_ the online platform known for subscription-based pornographic content is in talks to sell a majority stake to Architect Capital, an investment firm based in San Francisco.

According to the report, the proposed deal includes $3.5 billion in equity and $2 billion in debt, which values OnlyFans at $5.5 billion. _TechCrunch_ also reported that Architect Capital and OnlyFans are currently in exclusive talks, where the website's owner can't negotiate with other potential buyers for a certain amount of time.

With no set timeline yet for the deal, the deal is far from an official closing. Last year, OnlyFans' owner Leonid Radvinsky was also negotiating with another investment firm, Forest Road Company, to [sell the platform](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/onlyfans-is-in-talks-to-sell-for-8-billion-165318788.html). Although that deal never went through, the talks leading up to the sale valued OnlyFans at a much higher $8 billion. The London-based website, which still doesn't want to be known as just a [porn site](https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-suspends-ban-on-sexually-explicit-content-132256309.html), is still growing and reported a nine percent increase in gross revenue for its 2024 fiscal year, earning more than [$7.2 billion](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/onlyfans-fiscal-2024-revenue-earnings-1236495750/).
