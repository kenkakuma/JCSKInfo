We've known there was a film adaptation of _Helldivers_ [coming for a while](https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1876443914431070654), but we now have a director and writer. Justin Lin will helm the movie and Gary Dauberman is writing the script, [according to _The Hollywood Reporter_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/).

Justin Lin is a great choice here. He directed many of the more beloved Fast & Furious entries and helmed the [criminally underrated _Star Trek Beyond_](https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-14-star-trek-beyond-trailer.html). _Helldivers_ is kind of a mix of both. It has outer space stuff, but also stylish action that occasionally borders on satire. Lin hasn't made that many movies in recent years, but did [sign on to adapt](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-film-adaptation-of-keanu-reeves-brzrkr-now-has-its-director-184902694.html) the Keanu Reeves comic _BRZRKR_ for Netflix.

However, he's been all over TV screens. Lin has become a prolific TV producer, with credits on shows like _S.W.A.T._, _Scorpion_, _Magnum P.I._ and _Warrior_.

As for the script, Dauberman penned both _It_ and _It Chapter Two_. He also wrote _Annabelle_ and both of its follow-ups, along with _The Nun_ and a recent adaptation of _Salem's Lot_. He's mostly a horror guy, so we'll have to see how he does with over-the-top action.

For the uninitiated, _Helldivers_ [is a co-op shooter franchise](https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-20-co-op-shooter-helldivers-drops-this-summer-on-sony-systems.html) that's heavily inspired by the movie _Starship Troopers_. The games are set in a hyper-patriotic dystopia called Super Earth. _Helldivers 2_ dropped in 2024, but [just came out for Xbox](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-on-august-26-172937757.html) earlier this year. Sony has yet to announce a release date for the film adaptation, so it might be a while.

As an aside, _Helldivers 2_ developer Arrowhead Game Studios just dropped a [nifty update for the PC build](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371). It brings the file size down to 23GB from 154GB. That's a massive reduction of 131GB. We aren't sure what kind of compression wizardry went into that.
