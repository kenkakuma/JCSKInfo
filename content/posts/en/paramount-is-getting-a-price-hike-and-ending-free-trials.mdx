Paramount+ is making some changes that will make its streaming service get more to watch. During Paramount's earnings [report](https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/53c82d68-0e50-45cf-a8b9-3023c5ce9cc7) today, the company announced that it will increase the subscription prices for Paramount+ in the US during the first quarter of 2026. Price hikes were also announced today for viewers in Canada and Australia. The new pricing was not shared, but a dollar or two more per month has become the standard change. Considering most streaming services jack their prices every year or two, the news was probably inevitable; the last increase for Paramount+ was back in [June 2024](https://www.engadget.com/paramount-is-raising-prices-again-for-all-of-the-tulsa-king-stans-out-there-183720943.html). But today's announcement also revealed that Paramount+ will no longer offer free trials, which is a common practice for most digital entertainment subscriptions. 

The changes appear to be part of a reassessment of the Paramount+ finances. The company's approach to increase long-term profitability "includes shifting away from certain hard bundles and low-margin subscriptions, reducing investment in select international markets without a clear path to sufficient scale, retiring free trials, and reviewing discount practices."

These new moves follow Skydance's [acquisition](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/fcc-approves-skydances-8-billion-paramount-acquisition-032028104.html) of Paramount over the summer, an $8 billion purchase which received regulatory approval after some pretty scuzzy interactions with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.
