Indie game developer Edmund McMillen hosted a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pj8wqu/edmund_mcmillen_here_creator_of_the_binding_of/) today offering some more details about his upcoming game _Mewgenics_. For starters, the Steam release date for this turn-based cat-breeding RPG has been slightly delayed to February 10. The game was first announced all the way back in 2012 and had most recently been [slated](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-creator-of-binding-of-isaac-will-release-a-new-game-mewgenics-this-year-211049653.html) for a launch some time this year. Part of the long development cycle was so that McMillen could pause to launch [_Super Meat Boy Forever_](https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-31-super-meat-boy-forever-trims-fat-cooks-up-huge-challenge.html), the sequel to his _Super Meat Boy_ platforming hit from 2010. Gamers may also know McMillen for _The Binding of Isaac_, which has had some notable crossovers with titles [like _Balatro_](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/your-balatro-deck-can-now-feature-binding-of-isaac-characters-191009810.html) in recent years.   

Other tidbits from the AMA include the promise that McMillen already has DLC ideas, so expect to have additional content release after the base game is available. Although there doesn't seem to be any lack of replayability in Mewgenics; McMillen said "I currently have 300+ hours across 2 saves and have only beaten the game on one save so far." There is also a plan to have some console versions of the game, although likely not until much later next year at the soonest, the dev added.
