[Proton VPN](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234) is offering a steep discount on its Proton VPN Plus subscription, with the two-year plan currently priced at $2.99 per month. You’ll pay $72 upfront for 24 months of service, which amounts to 70 percent off the usual monthly rate and brings the long-term cost well below what many premium VPNs typically charge.

We’ve consistently been impressed by Proton VPN’s focus on privacy, its nonprofit ownership structure and the way it balances security features with strong real-world speeds. It’s a top pick in our [best VPN guide](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html), and this promotion also appears in our running list of the [best VPN deals](https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html). If you’re planning to commit to a VPN for the long haul, this pricing makes [Proton VPN Plus](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html) one of the more compelling options available right now.

In our [Proton VPN review](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html), the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.

Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.

Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a [30-day money-back guarantee](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html), so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.
