Samsung has unveiled its newest smartphone, and it's the highly-anticipated Galaxy Z TriFold. During an [interview](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-plans-to-launch-its-trifold-smartphone-by-the-end-of-2025-122358763.html) in July, a Samsung exec confirmed that the company was working on a three-panel phone that it aimed to release by the end of the year. The company said it expects the phone to be available for purchase in Korea on December 12, with markets including China, Taiwan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. For US shoppers, the TriFold will be available in the first quarter of 2026, but no specific date has been revealed yet.

The phone has an inward-folding design intended to protect the main display. If it has been folded incorrectly, the device will automatically vibrate and show an on-screen alert to notify its user. When fully extended, the TriFold has a 10-inch screen and the cover screen is 6.5 inches when folded up. It is 3.9mm at its thinnest point when unfolded and then 12.9mm while collapsed. 

To give that some context, the [Galaxy Z Fold 7](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html) is a traditional foldable that also has a 6.5-inch exterior screen and an internal display that opens to 8 inches wide diagonally. It has a profile of 8.9mm when folded and weighs 215 grams compared with the TriFold's 309 grams. With its two-hinge form, the TriFold makes it so you have basically a ten-inch tablet that folds down to a slightly heftier version of the Z Fold 7.

Foldables introduce some additional design demands, and Samsung said that the screen panels meet with minimal gap but no actual contact when they are closed. The hinges have been designed to resist wear and the screen received a new reinforced overcoat to improve resistance. 

The phone runs on a custom Snapdragon 8 chip. It has a 5,600mAh three-cell battery system and offers 45W super-fast charging. The rear camera lineup includes a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 200MP wide-angle lens and a 10MP telephoto lens, which is identical to the setup on the Z Fold 7. The main screen and the cover screen both have 10MP front cameras. 

No pricing information is currently available, but it seems like a safe assumption that this will be expensive. The Z Fold 7 starts at $2,000, so expect to pay a premium for that second hinge.
