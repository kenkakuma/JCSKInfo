Toyota has unveiled the 2027 Highlander, the first fully electric version of the vehicle and the automaker’s fourth EV in the US. It’s also the company’s first EV assembled in the country and the first electric model with three rows of seats. The automaker already sells the electric [C-HR crossover](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-is-bringing-the-c-hr-back-to-the-us-as-an-all-electric-crossover-170728601.html) and the electric [bZ SUV](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-hopes-for-a-smoother-start-with-its-redesigned-bz-all-electric-suv-182426253.html) in the US. While the 2027 Highlander resembles its predecessors, its lines look sharper and it has broader fenders. In addition, it features flush door handles similar to Tesla’s, which were designed for aerodynamics but which China [recently banned](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a70249660/china-outlawing-flush-door-handles/) out of safety concerns.

The new Highlander will be available in several varieties, specifically in Limited and XLE (Executive Luxury Edition) grades with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive configuration. If you get the Limited edition all-wheel drive with a 95.8 kWh battery, you can get a range of 320 miles on a single charge, based on Toyota’s estimates. Take note that range estimates by manufacturers and the EPA could be different from each other. It would be more accurate to compare EPA ranges between vehicles across brands, because they were determined using the agency’s testing methodologies.

The 2027 Highlander in XLE front wheel drive configuration with a 77 kWh battery has a manufacturer-estimated range of 287 miles. Meanwhile, the all-wheel drive XLE variant comes with either a 77 kWh battery that can power it for 270 miles or a 95.8 kWh battery that has an estimated range of 320 miles, similar to the Limited edition vehicle. The all-wheel drive variants have a total maximum power output of 338 horsepower, whereas the front-wheel models have a power output of 221 hp.

All the EV’s versions can seat seven, with the third row being able to fold flat if you need it for cargo. They come with heated front seats, but you can also get ventilated and heated second row seats for an additional fee. Toyota will start selling the 2027 Highlander in late 2026, with some regions getting it early next year. The automaker says it will announce pricing for the EV model closer to its release date.
