Belkin just introduced the appropriately-named Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 at CES. This is a high-end charging case specifically designed for Nintendo's latest console.

The 10,000mAh power bank delivers up to 30W of fast charging, which is a decent enough metric. I'm more excited, however, about the bells and whistles. The Charging Case Pro boasts an LCD screen on the exterior, making it easy to keep track of remaining battery life. It also doubles as a tabletop stand, which is always nice. The built-in Switch 2 stand is better than what we got [with the first Switch](https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-10-nintendo-switch-adjustable-charging-stand.html), but it's still not the sturdiest thing in the world.

It also includes a dedicated flap for game card storage and a hidden compartment for smart trackers. Take that, would-be Switch 2 thieves. Belkin promises this case has been made from premium materials and has been designed for "long-term durability." The Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 is available right now and costs $100.

The company also introduced a number of other charging accessories at CES. The UltraCharge Pro Power Bank juices up two devices at once and also costs $100, with availability in February. The BoostCharge power bank is an extremely slim unit that easily slides into pockets. That one starts at $60, but isn't coming until later in the year.
