In other words, folks with a passport who have yet to upgrade a driver's license to a Real ID will be able to board a plane without bringing a physical copy of that passport to the airport. This whole Real ID thing [has been a source of frustration](https://www.engadget.com/real-id-deadline-delay-2025-224526308.html) to many, so I appreciate any effort to make traveling a bit easier.

This ID will be visible on both iPhones and the Apple Watch and Apple says the service is being implemented at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 US-based airports. It's only used for ID on domestic flights; if you're planning to travel internationally you'll still need a physical passport.

Also, not all TSA readers have been implemented with the technology to scan these digital IDs just yet, [according to _TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/apple-launches-digital-id-a-way-to-carry-your-passport-on-your-phone-for-use-at-tsa-checkpoints/). You might want to bring along a paper passport for the time being to let the TSA and Apple get their ducks in a row.

Apple

The company has plans to expand this feature beyond air travel. Apple says businesses will eventually be able to accept these IDs for the purposes of age verification. This Digital ID feature [was first announced as part of iOS 26](https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-wallets-ios-26-update-scans-your-emails-for-package-delivery-tracking-123054484.html) and also adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet.

Adding a passport seems simple enough. Just head to the Wallet app and follow the prompts. Users will have to pose for a selfie and complete a series of facial and head movements for security.

The wallet platform also accepts driver's licences and state IDs, but only in 12 states and Puerto Rico. These won't be valid for flying, however, as neither is a Real ID or passport.
