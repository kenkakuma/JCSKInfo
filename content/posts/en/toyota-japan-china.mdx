summary: Toyota Motor Corporation announced on the 14th that its new vehicle sales in China for September totaled 158,900 units, down 1.0% from the same month last year, marking the first decline in eight months. The decline is attributed to consumers holding off on purchases in anticipation of discounts during the National Day holiday and the partial end of subsidy policies. Among the sales results of the three major Japanese automakers announced the same day, Honda struggled with a 13.1% decline, while Nissan Motor maintained a slight increase.​

**Japanese Big Three See Diverging Fortunes**

Honda recorded 54,544 units (down 13.1% year-on-year), marking 20 consecutive months of decline. Meanwhile, Nissan Motor sold 61,552 units (up 0.3%), surpassing the previous year's figure for the fourth consecutive month. Nissan's sales were supported by the electric vehicle "N7," which kept prices down by using many Chinese-made parts, but the hit appears to be cooling off.​

According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China's overall new vehicle sales in September reached 3.226 million units, up 14.9% year-on-year. Sales of New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) continue to perform well, growing to account for approximately 48% of total automobile sales.​

**Intensifying Competitive Environment**

In the Chinese automotive market, fierce price competition continues among local manufacturers, led by BYD. Chinese manufacturers' global market share has expanded to 38% as of August 2025, forcing Japanese manufacturers into intense competition.​

Toyota has explained that it was "affected by the expansion of discounts from competitors such as Chinese manufacturers". The impact of intensifying competition has manifested in Toyota's sales, which had been increasing for seven consecutive months through August.​
