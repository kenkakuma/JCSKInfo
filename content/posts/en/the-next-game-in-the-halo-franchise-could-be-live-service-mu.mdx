Nearly four years after the release of [_Halo: Infinite_](https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-preview-xbox-series-x-080130895.html), the sixth installment in the franchise has failed to live up to its name. Instead, the studio behind the sci-fi series may be working on a "live service, long-term updating multiplayer" Halo game that could do just that. According to YouTuber [Rebs Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E), a source claimed that Halo Studios, previously known as [343 Industries](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-itself-to-halo-studios-120041943.html), is working on a multiplayer Halo title that could borrow _Fortnite_'s model of constantly pushing out content updates. The report also noted that there aren't any mentions of _Fortnite_'s battle royale style for the upcoming game.

While live service games are becoming the norm, veterans of the Halo franchise may not have much faith in Halo Studios after failing to deliver on _Halo: Infinite_'s longevity. Back in March, another [report](https://twistedvoxel.com/halo-infinite-scrapped-10-year-content-plan-revealed/) revealed that _Halo: Infinite_ was meant to be supported with a 10-year plan of consistent updates, but this roadmap was scrapped following leadership issues and a switch to Unreal Engine. While _Halo: Infinite_'s multiplayer mode has received notable updates since its initial release, the game still sits at a Mixed rating on Steam.

Along with this upcoming live service Halo title, the report claimed that the studio is working on a remake of the first game in the series, _Halo: Combat Evolved_. According to [John Junyszek](https://x.com/Unyshek/status/1978966083252937164), the senior community manager at Halo Studios, we could hear more about either project during the Halo World Championship that takes place from October 24 to 26.
