We [learned](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/call-of-duty-is-getting-the-movie-treatment-courtesy-of-paramount-171408410.html) last month that Call of Duty would be making the leap to the big screen with a planned motion picture project. Today, [_Deadline_](https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/) reported that two of the main creative forces behind the movie will be Taylor Sheridan and Peter Berg.Â 

Sheridan and Berg previously both worked on the 2016 film _Hell or High Water_ and 2017's _Wind River_. Berg was a producer on those projects, but he's perhaps better known as a writer for the football drama _Friday Night Lights_. Sheridan's most recent endeavor was TV series _Yellowstone_, and he also worked on _Lioness_, _Mayor of Kingstown_ and _Tulsa King_. For Paramount's _Call of Duty_ adaptation, both will produce and co-write, while Berg is currently on board to direct.

Since the writers and director have only just been locked down, there still hasn't been any public discussion of what era of the lucrative CoD franchise the movie will tackle. Based on the duo's past work, something contemporary seems most likely, but it may be awhile before we have any confirmation of the story or casting.
