As we wrap up 2025, we’re looking at the year’s [biggest winners](https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html): the people, companies, products and trends that made the most impact over the year. Almost at the top of the pile, of course, are the tech billionaires. 

According to a recent report by Oxfam, the 10 richest US billionaires (who are all tech leaders, save for Warren Buffet) increased their wealth by $698 billion in 2025. Some of that has been spent treating and lavishing donations on President Trump. Elon Musk reportedly donated nearly $300 million to Trump and Republican allies, and several tech companies have pitched in to build the president’s White House ballroom.

Thanks to updates from Meta, Google, OpenAI and others, AI video is more realistic and easier to make than ever. AI video is everywhere. It’s not only overtaken your Facebook and Instagram recommendations, but Meta created an entirely separate feed just for users’ AI-generated fever dreams. The numbers are huge: OpenAI’s Sora, which lets you make AI videos of real people, was downloaded a million times in just a few days. And Google’s Veo generated more than 40 million videos in a few weeks of launching. AI slop is here to stay, and it’s everywhere.

We didn’t say the winners would all be positive. But hey, the Switch 2 is great.

### Good news for WBD?

Paramount wasn’t going to let Netflix pick up Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) without a fight. Following the streaming service’s $82.7 billion deal to buy much of WBD, Paramount is making a [hostile takeover bid](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html) of $108 billion, pitching directly to WBD shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, which expires on January 8.

Last week, the WBD board unanimously accepted Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share. That breaks down to $23.25 per share in cash and another $4.50 per share in Netflix stock. Paramount, however, wants to pick up the entirety of WBD, while Netflix only wants the studios and streaming businesses.

Whoever bought (or buys?) WBD would face government opposition from all sides. Paramount had already sent WBD a letter questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the acquisition bidding process before its hostile takeover bid.

President Trump warned the Netflix deal could be a “problem.” According to data from JustWatch, a combined Netflix and HBO would account for 33 percent of the US streaming video market.

### Tekken’s leading face and voice for decades.

Katsuhiro Harada is departing Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. He announced the news both with a farewell note shared on X and, of course, an hour-long DJ mix. Harada’s 30-year career has been most closely involved with Tekken, and he’s a familiar face in the fighting game community.

Harada wrote on X: “To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.”
