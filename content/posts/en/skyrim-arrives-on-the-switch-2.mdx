You can add the Switch 2 to the (long) list of platforms where you can play _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_. The bad news: It costs $60 to play [the 2011 game](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-10-skyrim-review.html) optimized for [Nintendo's 2025 hardware](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html). The good news: It costs less (or nothing) if you own one of the versions for the original Switch.

The (digital-only) Switch 2 port is [the Anniversary Edition of _Skyrim_](https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-10th-anniversary-edition-skyrim-084030796.html), released in 2021. That includes the base game and three expansions (_Dawnguard_, _Dragonborn_ and _Hearthfire_). You'll also find hundreds of Creation Club items, like quests, weapons, armor, spells and dungeons. The Anniversary Edition's Zelda crossover content (Master Sword, Hylian Shield and Champion's Tunic) is also there. So, at least there's plenty of content.

The game also offers technical upgrades for the Switch 2 hardware. It has enhanced resolution, DLSS anti-aliasing, faster load times and general performance optimizations. There's also mouse support, motion controls and Amiibo support. The trailer below gives you an idea of what to expect.

In an [interview](https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release) with _Nintendo Life_, Bethesda Creative Director Matt Carofano said the Switch 2 port was "an easy development process and actually pretty quick" to make. He described the team's motivation for porting it as bringing back "one of our most beloved games to the Switch 2 and see how we can improve it and make it the best experience for that console."

Okay, cool, but I'm gonna go on a limb and say money was also a factor. That’s because, if you don't already own Skyrim for the OG Switch, you'll have to fork over a whopping $60 [in the Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-upgrade-70050000036389-switch/) for the 14-year-old game. Meanwhile, if you own the standard version of _Skyrim_ for the original Switch, you’ll pay $20 to upgrade. Finally, if you have the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition_ on the OG Switch, you can install the new version for free.

If you own the Switch 1 version, first install that on Switch 2 and start the game. When you see the eShop banner advertising the new version, press Y to access the store and upgrade. You can do that with both digital and physical versions of _Skyrim_ for Switch 1.
