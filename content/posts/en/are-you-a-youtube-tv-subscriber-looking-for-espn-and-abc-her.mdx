If you're a YouTube TV subscriber, you may have noticed that ABC, ESPN and other Disney-owned channels have gone dark on the platform today. The Walt Disney Co. has [pulled its channels from YouTube TV](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html) as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement.

That means that until that negotiation is resolved, you won't be able to watch any programming from those stations. That includes all upcoming college football and NFL games broadcast on ESPN's suite of channels —including _Monday Night Football_ — as well as all ABC programming like _Abbott Elementary_, _Grey's Anatomy_ and _Dancing with the Stars_.

YouTube TV has stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. That's all fine and good, but if you're looking to watch one of those upcoming games, you're likely looking for a solution as soon as Friday night. The good news is that there are plenty of ways to get those channels back. If you want a permanent switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you _can_ watch all of those channels. If you're looking for a workaround for this weekend (or for the long term) to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, here's are the best options so you won't miss a moment of sports, news, or entertainment, all pulled from our list of [best live TV streaming services to cut cable](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html). 

## Grab an ESPN bundle so you won't miss a single game this weekend

## Get Hulu + Live TV at a great price

## Try Fubo free for a week and get $30 your first month

## Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month

## What about Sling "day passes"?

You may have heard that [Sling offers day, weekend and week passes](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/sling-tv-launches-a-5-day-pass-for-commitment-free-cable-150021645.html) to its streaming programming for as little as $5 per day. That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the [Sling Orange](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d1c9a21f-4263-4b41-b619-0f75ee410a45&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Sling+TV&linkText=Sling+Orange&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbGluZy5jb20vc2VydmljZS9zbGluZy1vcmFuZ2UiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxYzlhMjFmLTQyNjMtNGI0MS1iNjE5LTBmNzVlZTQxMGE0NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3NlcnZpY2Uvc2xpbmctb3JhbmdlIn0&signature=AQAAAbQNsyHVoqqGrCK2uUWWsoTmJixhbsecRFvs0n76GM7o&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fservice%2Fsling-orange) tier), but ABC isn't included. You can get both with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge. 

## Get your local Disney/ABC programming for free

Need your local ABC programming? Your station may have its own free local streaming news channel (many do), you can see if [The Roku Channel](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d1c9a21f-4263-4b41-b619-0f75ee410a45&featureId=text-link&linkText=The+Roku+Channel&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RoZXJva3VjaGFubmVsLnJva3UuY29tL3NlYXJjaC9hYmMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQxYzlhMjFmLTQyNjMtNGI0MS1iNjE5LTBmNzVlZTQxMGE0NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyb2t1Y2hhbm5lbC5yb2t1LmNvbS9zZWFyY2gvYWJjIn0&signature=AQAAARsu92PhajFJ1OZtj8p6_xT0_Mxhe-KNKgACgSreTLaV&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftherokuchannel.roku.com%2Fsearch%2Fabc) carries your local station's news, or download your local news station app if it's a [Nexstar](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=d1c9a21f-4263-4b41-b619-0f75ee410a45&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Nexstar&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3M_az1uZXhzdGFyK2FwcHMmaT1tb2JpbGUtYXBwcyZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMWM5YTIxZi00MjYzLTRiNDEtYjYxOS0wZjc1ZWU0MTBhNDUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vcz9rPW5leHN0YXIrYXBwcyZpPW1vYmlsZS1hcHBzIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&signature=AQAAAZUJATNk3qf7-o_74V-fSeGN3aRTNTqPnZaVuLZh8bJ5&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dnexstar%2Bapps%26i%3Dmobile-apps) channel. 

The other alternative — if you're within the broadcast radius of a local ABC affiliate — is to get an over-the-air antenna. You can plug in your ZIP code at [antennaweb.org](https://www.antennaweb.org/) to see what channels are in your area.
