The wait for a new Mac Pro may take a lot longer, according to the latest [Power On](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o) newsletter. _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman reported that the Mac Pro has an uncertain future within Apple's desktop strategy and isn't likely to see a refresh in 2026.

According to Gurman, Apple is no longer working on the M4 Ultra chip, which was meant to be offered in a refreshed Mac Pro. Instead, Apple is planning for the M5 Ultra to be its "high-end desktop chip," which will only be available on the [Mac Studio](https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-mac-studio-m4-max-review-a-creative-powerhouse-123000265.html) so far, according to Gurman.

Despite earning a solid reputation amongst creatives looking for a Mac desktop, the Mac Pro has fallen out of favor even after [sporadic refreshes](https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-pro-w6800x-w6900-gpu-154228019.html) between 2013 and 2023. Apple experimented with some risky redesigns, including the "trash can" style, but the [current Mac Pro model](https://www.engadget.com/apple-refreshes-the-mac-pro-with-its-new-m2-ultra-chip-173145016.html) returns to a modern cheese grater look while also upgrading to Apple silicon with the M2 Ultra chip. However, Apple customers seeking the most powerful desktop options might be more likely to opt for the latest Mac Studio with the M4 Ultra. Gurman also reported that Apple is internally shifting towards the Mac Studio as the focus of Apple's professional desktop offerings.
