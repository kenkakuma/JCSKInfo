There may not be any reports of [stick drift](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-says-the-switch-2-joy-cons-dont-have-hall-effect-thumbsticks-for-reducing-stick-drift-145541325.html) with the [ROG Xbox Ally](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html) yet, but that doesn't mean there won't be. If you'd rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest [TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/3586643.html) made specifically for your Xbox handheld.

GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X's stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect [joystick upgrade kit](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1363656.html) for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient. GuliKit even made the joystick upgrades easy to install since there's no soldering required, and you can fine-tune the calibration in the handheld's system settings.

It may feel excessive to spend more money on a gaming handheld that can cost up to $1,000, but neither the ROG Xbox Ally nor Ally X comes with Hall effect or electromagnetic joysticks. GuliKit's joystick upgrade is already available to US customers on its [Amazon storefront](https://www.amazon.com/ROG-Xbox-Ally-Electromagnetic-Thumbstick-Replacement/dp/B0G4QW8798) for $19.99.
