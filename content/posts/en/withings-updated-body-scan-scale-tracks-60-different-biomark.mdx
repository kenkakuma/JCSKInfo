Back in 2023, Withings launched [Body Scan, a super-premium scale with the sort of tech found in a high-end gym or low-end clinic](https://www.engadget.com/withings-body-scan-connected-health-station-is-amazing-if-inessential-140001021.html). It had a six-lead ECG, offered segmented body composition and could monitor your nerve health, among other things. Now the company has rocked up at CES 2026 in Las Vegas with a second-generation model that adds in tests for hypertension and cellular health. Withings hopes the new model will give you even more data you can use to fight against chronic illnesses brought on by our decadent modern lifestyle.

The first generation Body Scan checked 40 biomarkers, while the new model has 60, and even the press materials need a bulleted list to talk about the new features. Topping the bill is the new Impedance Cardiography (ICG) which monitors your heart’s capacity to pump blood to the organs. Second, Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) uses a low level electrical current to check your body’s total water, letting the scale keep an eye on your cellular age, active cell mass and metabolic efficiency.

Naturally, all of this data will then be extruded through the company’s “clinically validated” AI model to offer more insights, such as your risk of hypertension and glycemic regulation. You’ll also be told, based on your vital statistics, your health trajectory, and given tips on how to improve your “healthspan.” In short, the company wants to further position this as a clinic in a box, steering you toward healthier choices as and when it can.

There’s one major hardware tweak from the first generation, as the retractable handle used for the ECG now contains the scale’s display. That, I’m sure, makes it easier to read if you’re squinting naked onto the scale after your morning shower. But I’m also concerned that it’s a single point of failure for the thin cable attaching the handle to the rest of the scale. 

Withings hopes to get the Body Scan 2 cleared by the FDA in time for its planned launch in the second quarter of 2026. As for the price, expect to pay a pretty penny for the flagship gear, as it will set you back $599.95, €499.95 or £449.95, depending on your territory.
