One of the many concerns about artificial intelligence these days is how the rush to build data centers is impacting local communities. Data centers can create a [drain on resources](https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html), and some utility companies have already said customers can expect to see their electricity bills [growing](https://www.engadget.com/ai/major-us-power-operator-says-ai-and-data-center-demands-are-pushing-prices-up-130030473.html) as these facilities increase demand. There have been some discussions of what other [power sources](https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html) could support the AI engine, and wind power specialist Airloom is one company that's looking to address the problem. Ahead of the business' upcoming appearance at CES, we've learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.

Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom's structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom's towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice.

It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn't in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom's work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.
