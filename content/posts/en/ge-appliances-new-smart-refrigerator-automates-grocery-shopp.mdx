Smart fridges are a dime a dozen at CES, and [LG](https://www.engadget.com/lg-mood-up-refrigerator-uses-led-panels-to-color-shift-your-kitchen-093402450.html) and [Samsung](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsungs-very-expensive-family-hub-fridges-will-now-treat-you-to-ads-on-their-displays-143529070.html) have thoroughly explored what's possible when you connect your fridge to the internet or slap a touchscreen on the front. The new [GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant](https://pressroom.geappliances.com/news/ge-profileTM-unveils-game-changing-smart-refrigerator-with-kitchen-assistantTM-revolutionizing-grocery-shopping-and-meal-planning?preview=ffaf&preview_mode=True) GE Appliances is announcing ahead of CES 2026 doesn't reinvent the wheel in that regard, but it does include a first: a built-in barcode scanner for adding items to your shopping list.

GE Appliances’ "Scan-to-List" feature uses the barcode scanner to quickly (and precisely) add items to a shareable shopping list in the company’s SmartHQ app. You can refer to that list while you're shopping in person, or sync it  with Instacart and have it delivered, eliminating the need to go grocery shopping entirely. Inside the fridge, GE Appliances also includes a flush-mount LED bar with a built-in camera that can deliver "real-time, on-demand snapshots of crisper drawers, focusing on the most costly and perishable items." This "FridgeFocus" feature is supposed to prevent you from overbuying perishable produce that you might already have, by letting you see which perishables might go bad first.

GE Appliances' fridge is stainless steel and has a built-in touchscreen display.

On top of those smart features, the GE Profile Smart Refrigerator has a four-door stainless steel design, with door-in-door storage and an adjustable temperature drawer. The fridge also has an 8-inch touchscreen display for viewing recipes or the current weather conditions, and microphones for accepting voice commands. When you're dispensing water, the fridge's water dispenser is supposed to be smart enough to fill a container with the exact right amount of water using built-in sensors, too.

The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant will be available from GE Appliances and select retailers starting in April 2026 for a suggested MSRP of $4,899.
