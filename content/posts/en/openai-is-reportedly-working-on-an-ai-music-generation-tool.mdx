The company envisions something that could be used to generate guitar accompaniment for a vocal track, for example, or to add music to videos, sources with knowledge of the project told the publication. 

There's no word on how far into these efforts OpenAI is. According to one source that spoke to _The Information_, OpenAI enlisted the Juilliard students to annotate music scores, which could be used to train the AI. It wouldn't be the first time [the company](https://openai.com/index/musenet/) has explored [music-generating AI](https://openai.com/index/jukebox/), and it's something we're seeing more and more of elsewhere with other startups, like [Suno](https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-startup-argues-scraping-every-song-on-the-internet-is-fair-use-233132459.html) and [ElevenLabs](https://www.engadget.com/ai/elevenlabs-launches-its-own-royalty-free-ai-music-service-183033630.html), launching their own versions. AI spam is already [cluttering up](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/spotify-is-doing-more-to-address-ai-slop-on-its-platform-151102801.html) [streaming platforms](https://www.engadget.com/ai/deezer-reports-18-percent-of-the-music-uploaded-to-its-service-every-day-is-ai-generated-193652533.html) and, lest we forget, there was the whole [The Velvet Sundown debacle](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/spotifys-latest-breakout-band-the-velvet-sundown-appears-to-be-ai-generated-and-fans-arent-happy). It's only the beginning.
