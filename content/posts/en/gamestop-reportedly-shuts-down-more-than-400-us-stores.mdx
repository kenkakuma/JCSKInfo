Your neighborhood [GameStop](https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-gamestop-store-renovations.html) might be on the chopping block, along with more than 400 other retail locations across the US. As first reported by [_Polygon_](https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/), the retailer is pursuing a severe cost-saving measure by closing up several hundred physical locations. According to a [blog](https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/) that keeps track of GameStop closures, there are 410 locations that are confirmed to be closing or are already closed, along with another 11 that are reportedly also on their way, as of January 10. 

As _Polygon_ indicated, these closings aren't much of a surprise considering GameStop's SEC filing for December 2025 indicated that it would "anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025," which ends on January 31, 2026. The same filing detailed that the company's board would pay out the GameStop CEO, Ryan Cohen, up to $35 billion in stock options, given that he increases the retailer's market cap to $100 billion.

While the blog covers only closures in the US, the SEC filing also noted that GameStop is planning to reduce its presence in several other European countries and Canada. Even though GameStop saw a [historic spike](https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-reddit-ceo-testify-house-gamestop-hearing-152845471.html) in market value in 2021, it has struggled with the brand's direction, as seen with failed attempts at offering a [crypto locker](https://www.engadget.com/gamestops-nft-wallet-will-shut-down-in-november-164252057.html) and [an NFT marketplace](https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-axes-its-short-lived-nft-marketplace-as-it-retreats-from-crypto-215911813.html).
