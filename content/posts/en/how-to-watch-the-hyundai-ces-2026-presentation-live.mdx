A look at Hyundai's Holographic Windshield Display. (Hyundai)

CES has long felt like a full-on auto show, but the car-centric energy seems somewhat muted at [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html). Sure, the [Afeela electric vehicle](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html) from the [Sony-Honda joint venture](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html) is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration [yanking most EV incentives](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html) from the market, the industry isn't offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there's no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai's [Holographic Windshield Display](https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2026/holographic-windshield-display/)[.](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html)

Indeed, the company's [Mobis subsidiary](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-mobis-to-unveil-30-new-technologies-at-ces-2026-aiming-to-strengthen-global-oem-partnerships-302635135.html) will present "more than 30 mobility convergence technologies" during CES. And we'll also get to see Hyundai's [AI Robotics Strategy](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/0000001093), which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.

## How to watch Hyundai's presentation at CES 2026

Hyundai's presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its [HyundaiUSA YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hyundai/streams) or its [global YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HyundaiMotorGroup). We'll embed the stream here once it's available.

## What to expect

As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It's essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle's dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver's view. It's a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.

Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the "world's first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface." It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don't expect to see this on the market anytime soon.

Beyond automotive, though, we'll also get a first-ever look at the company's new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was [purchased by the Korean multinational](https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-acquires-boston-dynamics-1-1-billion-110901223.html) back in 2020.

"This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers," the company said in the same press release.

Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.
