TikTok is finally "[back to normal](https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/Technical-issues-impacting-TikTok-US-service)" in the US after days of technical issues and outages tied to winter storms. Less than a week after companies like Oracle took [ownership of TikTok's domestic operations](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-finalizes-deal-for-its-us-entity-010543484.html), the platform faced a major power outage when one of its primary US data center sites — run by Oracle — got taken down by the storm. 

The problems started last Monday, January 26, when TikTok announced it was working on a "major infrastructure issue" and warned of bugs, time-out requests, missing earnings, and more. The next day TikTok shared that progress has been made but there were still some issues. It added, "Creators may temporarily see '0' views or likes on videos, and your earnings may look like they're missing. This is a display error caused by server timeouts; your actual data and engagement are safe."

Then, yesterday, February 1, TikTok claimed the problem was straightened out and that users shouldn't experience any more related issues. "We're sorry about the issues experienced by our U.S. community. We appreciate how much you count on TikTok to create, discover, and connect with what matters to you," the platform stated in its update. "Thank you for your patience and understanding."

A number of US users have [uninstalled TikTok](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/people-are-uninstalling-tiktok-and-downloading-an-indie-competitor-233345222.html) in response to its new ownership and technical issues. Some users also claimed that TikTok was censoring what they could post or what others saw. For instance, [_The Guardian_ reports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/01/tiktok-first-week#) that many people faced issues sharing videos about ICE agents killing Alex Pretti and general anti-ICE content. 

On January 26, analytics firm [Sensor Tower told _CNBC_](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-uninstalls-are-up-150percent-following-us-joint-venture.html) that uninstalls of the app had increased by over 150 percent during the five days since its change in ownership, when compared to the three months before. At the same time, independent app and competitor [UpScrolled](https://upscrolled.com/en/) saw a surge in downloads.
