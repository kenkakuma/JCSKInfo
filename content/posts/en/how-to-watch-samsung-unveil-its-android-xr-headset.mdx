**Editor's Note:** Samsung has officially announced the [$1,800 Galaxy XR headset](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-and-samsungs-first-android-xr-headset-is-the-1800-galaxy-xr-020004449.html). You can read our hands-on [here](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-a-smarter-more-open-take-on-apples-vision-pro-for-half-the-price-020044642.html) and how to order the device [here](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-order-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-020008173.html).Â 

Samsung [is set to officially reveal](https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-introduce-its-android-xr-headset-at-a-galaxy-event-on-october-21-230000605.html) its long-anticipated Android extended reality (XR) headset, which has been codenamed Project Moohan. The company [has scheduled a livestream event](https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-samsung-galaxy-event-worlds-wide-open-a-new-era-of-multimodal-ai) for October 21 at 10PM ET. That's just a few hours away, which is pretty much nothing compared to the years of lead-up to this reveal since Samsung and its partners have been teasing this device.

The event will be streamed live via the [company's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/samsung) and on the [official Samsung Newsroom site](https://news.samsung.com/global/). We don't know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the "true potential" of mixed-reality devices. You can bookmark this page and watch it right here.

This isn't just a reveal for a mixed-reality headset. Moohan is the very first device that uses [Google's new Android XR operating system](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html), which has been specifically designed for XR, VR and AR devices like glasses and headsets. Google has also shown previews of the ecosystem at its I/O developer conference before, and while we've seen bits and pieces of the software (and hardware) before, the final pieces should be available with the keynote today.

We don't have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been [plenty of leaks and rumors](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/the-final-details-of-samsungs-android-xr-headset-have-been-all-but-confirmed-200915560.html) that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream. Leaks [have suggested](https://chromeunboxed.com/why-im-so-excited-for-samsung-android-xr-event-and-its-not-just-the-headset/) it includes a high-end display, advanced tracking and Gemini integration. These same leaks indicate a potential price tag of $1,800 to $2,800, making it more of a rival to the Apple Vision Pro than [Meta's new Ray-Ban Display glasses](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-review-chunky-frames-with-impressive-abilities-193127070.html).

**Update, October 21 2025, 11:02PM ET** This story has been updated with links to Samsung's announcement and to our hands-on of the Galaxy XR.

**Update, October 21 2025, 2:48PM ET:** This story has been updated to point out the event is happening tonight in a few hours and talk about how Google has previously shown previews of its Android XR platform at its developer conference.
