Shortly after [rumors of a deal between the two](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-reportedly-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-hbo-082233278.html) media giants broke, Netflix has [announced it](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros) is buying Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max for approximately $82.7 billion. If approved, the deal will take place after Warner Bros. has disentangled itself from both its legacy cable and Discovery assets as part of the already-announced de-merger. That's likely to take place in the third quarter of 2026, with this new tie-up taking place at some point after that.

In a statement, Netflix said it expects to "maintain" Warner Bros. current operations, as well as its policy of theatrical releases for its films. But the deal may spell the end for HBO Max as its own product, as the statement also says "by adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose."

It's likely the deal will not go ahead without a lot of objections from other buyers, as well as the government itself. Yesterday, Paramount Skydance said (via [_the Hollywood Reporter)_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-calls-warner-bros-sale-process-unfair-in-blistering-letter-1236442302/) any deal between WB and Netflix would be the result of an "unfair" process. Given the close ties between Paramount's new owners and the administration, it's likely any deal will be subject to scrutiny as well as the usual questions around the size of the combined operation.
