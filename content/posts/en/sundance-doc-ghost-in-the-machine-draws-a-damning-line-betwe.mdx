The Sundance documentary _Ghost in the Machine_ boldly declares that the pursuit of artificial intelligence, and Silicon Valley itself, is rooted in eugenics. 

Director Valerie Veatch makes the case that the rise of techno-fascism from the likes of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel is a feature, not a bug. That may sound hyperbolic, but _Ghost in the Machine_, which is built around interviews with philosophers, AI researchers, historians and computer scientists, leaves little room for doubt.

If you've been following the meteoric rise of AI, or Silicon Valley in general, Veatch's methodical deconstruction of the technology doesn't really unearth anything new. The film begins with the utter failure of [Microsoft's Tay chatbot](https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-23-microsofts-tay-ai-chat-bot.html), which wasted no time in [becoming a Hitler-loving white supremacist](https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-25-its-not-tays-fault-that-it-turned-racist-its-ours.html). It retreads the [environmental impacts of AI datacenters](https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html), as well as the ways tech companies have [relied on low-wage workers from Africa](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=11f3334f-4881-48b9-97e7-07f459eda8bd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=time&linkText=relied+on+low-wage+workers+from+Africa&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RpbWUuY29tLzYyNDc2Nzgvb3BlbmFpLWNoYXRncHQta2VueWEtd29ya2Vycy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjExZjMzMzRmLTQ4ODEtNDhiOS05N2U3LTA3ZjQ1OWVkYThiZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lLmNvbS82MjQ3Njc4L29wZW5haS1jaGF0Z3B0LWtlbnlhLXdvcmtlcnMvIn0&signature=AQAAASmbjtXdvrtHRVhjiZ2Mh_R3JHayYXmZ1fF9MfjVAdN9&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F6247678%2Fopenai-chatgpt-kenya-workers%2F) and elsewhere to improve their algorithms. 

But even I was surprised to learn that we can trace the impact of eugenics in tech all the way back to Karl Pearson, the mathematician who pioneered the field of statistics, and who also spent his life trying to quantify the differences between races. (Guess who he believed was superior.) His legacy was [continued by William Shockley](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/Silicon-Valley-Shockley-racist-semiconductor-lab-13164228.php), a co-creator of the transistor, an avowed white supremacist who spent his later years espousing (now debunked) theories around IQ and racial differences.

Valerie Veatch for "Ghost in the Machine"

As a Stanford engineering professor, Shockley fostered a culture of prioritizing white men over women and minorities, which ultimately shaped the way Silicon Valley looks today. His line of thinking could have had an influence on John McCarthy, the Stanford researcher who coined the term “artificial intelligence” in 1955,  

With roots like that, Elon Musk — known to [spout bigotry online](https://futurism.com/civil-rights-groups-horrified-elon-musk-racist),  [foster a reportedly racist work environment at Tesla](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=11f3334f-4881-48b9-97e7-07f459eda8bd&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+New+York+Times&linkText=foster+a+reportedly+racist+work+environment+at+Tesla&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzAyLzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL3Rlc2xhLWVsb24tbXVzay1kZWktZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTFmMzMzNGYtNDg4MS00OGI5LTk3ZTctMDdmNDU5ZWRhOGJkIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI1LzAyLzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL3Rlc2xhLWVsb24tbXVzay1kZWktZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24uaHRtbCJ9&signature=AQAAAWESrEfg_Pwy9XFUe3nNut5PHHx7TEr5jND6TiktRSkv&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F02%2F06%2Fbusiness%2Ftesla-elon-musk-dei-discrimination.html) and  [throw the occasionaly few Nazi salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VfYjPzj1Xw) — looks less like an anomaly than part of a pattern. _Ghost in the Machine_ asks a simple question: How can we trust men like this (and it's almost always men that look like Musk) with our future?

Through its many interviews, which include the likes of AI researcher Dr. Emily Bender, historian Becca Lewis and media theorist Douglass Rushkoff, _Ghost in the Machine_ paints the rise of AI as a fascistic project that aims to demean humans and establish the techno-elite as our de facto rulers. Given how much our lives are already dominated by gadgets and social networks from companies that have pioneered addictive engagement over user safety, it's easy to imagine history repeating itself with AI. 

_Ghost in the Machine_ doesn't leave any room for considering potential benefits around AI, which could lead proponents of the technology to dismiss it as a hit-job. But we're currently at the apex of the AI hype cycle, after Big Tech has invested hundreds of billions of dollars on this technology, and after it has spent years shoving it down our throats without proving why it’s actually useful to many people. AI should be able to withstand a bit of criticism.

_Ghost in the Machine is available to view at the_ [_Sundance Film Festival’s website and streaming apps_](https://festival.sundance.org/tickets/online) _from today through the end of Sunday, February 1st._
