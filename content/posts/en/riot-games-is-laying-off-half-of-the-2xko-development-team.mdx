Another day, another wave of gaming layoffs. Today it's Riot Games with the [announcement](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko) that it's cutting jobs on its pair-based fighting game _2XKO_. For context, a representative from Riot [confirmed](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team) to _Game Developer_ that about 80 people are being cut, or roughly half of 2XKO's global development team. 

"As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with _2XKO_," according to the blog post from executive producer Tom Cannon. "The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."

The console launch for _2XKO_ happened [last month](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/riot-games-2xko-will-hit-consoles-on-january-20-185627826.html). Cannon said the company's plans for its 2026 competitive season have not altered with the layoffs. He added that Riot will attempt to place the impacted people at new positions within the company where possible.
