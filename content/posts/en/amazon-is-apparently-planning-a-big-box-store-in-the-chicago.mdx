Amazon is making a return, of sorts, to physical retail via plans to build a big-box retail store in the Chicago suburbs, [_The Information_ reports](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba0a4cdc-cec8-416a-9e93-e11b8179129c&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=6fa47371-d78c-4495-8719-c8823bf845ac&featureId=text-link&merchantName=The+Information&linkText=The+Information+reports&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYnJpZWZpbmdzL2FtYXpvbi1wbGFucy1iaWctYm94LXJldGFpbC1zdG9yZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmZhNDczNzEtZDc4Yy00NDk1LTg3MTktYzg4MjNiZjg0NWFjIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVpbmZvcm1hdGlvbi5jb20vYnJpZWZpbmdzL2FtYXpvbi1wbGFucy1iaWctYm94LXJldGFpbC1zdG9yZSJ9&signature=AQAAASjUe-25xGaSRvT3pCN4yH6D-eMc_O0UK9LtACp7QBiv&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Fbriefings%2Famazon-plans-big-box-retail-store). The 225,000-square foot retail space will open in Orland Park, Illinois, and give the company the opportunity to sell more than just groceries after it closed most of its [physical bookstores and gift shops](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-closing-bookstores-4-star-stores-210240474.html) in 2022.

The new store will offer in-store shopping, but also act as a fulfillment center for online orders, which could make it similar to competitors like Target and Walmart, and some of Amazon's existing Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh locations. "The proposed development will offer a wide selection of products, including groceries and general merchandise, with accessory services and potentially dining locations for prepared food sold onsite," Amazon wrote in a planning document _The Information_ viewed.

While best known as an online marketplace, Amazon has made multiple attempts to have a physical retail presence. [Amazon Books](https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-02-amazon-books-seattle.html) sold books based on what was trending on the company's website, [Amazon 4-star](https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-amazon-4-star.html) sold a variety of products that were rated four or more stars in Amazon reviews and the company's [Amazon Go](https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-05-amazon-go-grocery-store.html) stores sold pre-made food and select groceries via its cashier-less "Just Walk Out" technology. 

Amazon has abandoned basically all those experiments in favor of sticking with the grocery brand [it bought in 2017](https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-16-amazon-buying-whole-foods.html), Whole Foods, and the new one it’s formed in the years since, Amazon Fresh. This new store could be an entirely new concept, or an evolution of Amazon Fresh, but whatever it is, it'll have to be approved by the Orland Park Village Board to move forward, [according to the _Chicago Tribune_](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/07/orland-park-plan-commission-amazon-store/)_._
