The last time I used a set of [Noble Audio](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html) earbuds, the company [managed to pack five drivers](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-fokus-rex5-review-incredible-sound-if-youre-willing-to-pay-for-it-130043824.html) into the tiny housings. Now it’s back with a new model, the FoKus Prestige Encore, and despite only having four drivers this time, the company still took plenty of cues from its line of pro-grade in-ear monitors (IEMs). The biggest downside is that this new set is still plenty pricey, hitting your wallet for $699.

Inside, the [FoKus Prestige Encore](https://nobleaudio.com/collections/wireless-monitors) has one 8mm dynamic driver, two balanced armature drivers and one 6mm planar magnetic driver. According to Noble, each of these components have different duties. The dynamic drivers handle bass while the midrange goes to the Knowles balanced armature drivers. Lastly, the planar magnetic driver is tasked with the treble to “reveal microdetail.” The company says it also designed new “triple-vented” nozzles to make airflow efficient and the seal consistent.

Rather than using plastic or some other affordable material, Noble opted for solid wood for both the earbud housings and the charging case. Since this is the real thing and not a printed plate, each set of the FoKus Prestige Encore will have its own unique grain pattern — no two sets will look the same. What’s more, Noble reduced the overall size of the buds, which it says offers “a secure, fatigue-free fit.”

The FoKus Prestige Encore is equipped with hybrid active noice cancellation (ANC) and a transparency mode. The earbuds also support aptX Lossless, aptX Adaptive and LDAC for higher quality listening. For calls, dual noise suppression mics won’t overly process your voice for the sake of reducing background distractions, which Noble says will keep you sounding clear and natural in all settings.

Noble promises up to seven hours of use on a charge with ANC enabled or up to 10 hours with noise canceling turned off. When you factor in the case, you’re looking at up to 35 hours of total listening time. A quick-charge features will give you up to two hours of playback. The FoKus Prestige Encore also supports Audiodo for personalized calibration for each user’s hearing, and those profiles are stored on the earbuds for use on any device.

The Fokus Prestige Encore is available starting today for $699 (£649/€799).
