Withings announced that its multi-function medical device BeamO has received clearance from the FDA. BeamO contains sensors to perform an electrocardiogram, a stethoscope and a thermometer. The company claims all three tests can be completed in less than a minute.  It is now available for purchase and will retail for $250. 

The company [unveiled](https://www.engadget.com/the-withings-beamo-is-an-all-in-one-thermometer-ecg-and-stethoscope-010017439.html) BeamO at CES 2024. It's being positioned as a tool for telehealth, with a companion app that can send results to medical professionals. Withings is also offering a Cardio Check-Up service as part of its health subscription, where results from BeamO can be reviewed remotely by cardiologists who will deliver a cardiac health assessment to the device owner within 24 hours.

Withings is the name behind several intriguing (and occasionally strange) home health and smart tech items, including a [smartwatch](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/withings-introduces-a-39mm-version-of-its-scanwatch-nova-smartwatch-060056915.html), a highly futuristic [bathroom scale](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/withings-omina-is-its-vision-for-the-future-of-bathroom-scales-010024945.html) and a [toilet-mounted computer](https://www.engadget.com/home/withings-380-toilet-mounted-urine-analyzer-is-finally-ready-to-buy-040146049.html) for urine analysis.
