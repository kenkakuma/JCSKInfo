Vinyl records are [firmly back in rotation](https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-04-music-streaming-is-fueling-vinyls-resurgence.html), but getting started does not have to mean spending a fortune or building a complicated hi-fi stack from day one. Whether you want a simple, all-in-one setup with built-in speakers or you are piecing together a more traditional system with a separate amplifier, the best record player is the one that fits how you listen at home.

For this guide, we focused on high-quality turntables under $600 that deliver a satisfying listening experience without unnecessary complexity. These picks cover everything from beginner-friendly automatic models to more audiophile-leaning decks that prioritize sound quality and upgrade potential, proving you do not need to jump into the high-end to enjoy vinyl properly.

### Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT

This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you won’t be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession.

### Cambridge Audio Alva ST

The [Alva ST](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0B42FM7GZ&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c5aeffd4-6956-4f5a-99c5-d2f02da5c442&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Alva+ST&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0NhbWJyaWRnZS1BdWRpby1Ecml2ZS1UdXJudGFibGUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoL2RwL0IwQjQyRk03R1o_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzVhZWZmZDQtNjk1Ni00ZjVhLTk5YzUtZDJmMDJkYTVjNDQyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0NhbWJyaWRnZS1BdWRpby1Ecml2ZS1UdXJudGFibGUtQmx1ZXRvb3RoL2RwL0IwQjQyRk03R1oiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAWRr9XwkF1c89hsiWBoqq8V5bxt9cBoMfsHgqFdpG-FM&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCambridge-Audio-Drive-Turntable-Bluetooth%2Fdp%2FB0B42FM7GZ) has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between.

While the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. I’ve noticed albums don’t have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when they’re played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so it’s not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.)

### Denon DP-300F

[Denon’s DP-300F](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B000FMNBXG&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c5aeffd4-6956-4f5a-99c5-d2f02da5c442&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Denon%E2%80%99s+DP-300F&custData=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&signature=AQAAAbkDeLGaEFBnGZn3P_p4Qv7EIRHfPRZ6-iQ7beu_yTXH&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDenon-DP-300F-Automatic-Turntable-Equalizer%2Fdp%2FB000FMNBXG) is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denon’s cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer.

## How to shop for a turntable

The first question you’ll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when it’s done, that’s just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection you’ve invested in to sound its best, you’ll need to consider something with better specs. 

You’ll also need to account for where and how you’re going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers you’re going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if you’re going the wireless route.

### Automatic, semi-auto and manual operation

If you’re just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, there’s a button for that too. 

Some turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they can’t place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (that’s not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the [_It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown_ soundtrack](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B09XSZN9K9&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c5aeffd4-6956-4f5a-99c5-d2f02da5c442&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=It%27s+the+Great+Pumpkin%2C+Charlie+Brown+soundtrack&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1B1bXBraW4tQ2hhcmxpZS1UcmFuc2x1Y2VudC1PcmFuZ2UtU2hhcGVkL2RwL0IwOVhTWk45Szk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzVhZWZmZDQtNjk1Ni00ZjVhLTk5YzUtZDJmMDJkYTVjNDQyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1B1bXBraW4tQ2hhcmxpZS1UcmFuc2x1Y2VudC1PcmFuZ2UtU2hhcGVkL2RwL0IwOVhTWk45SzkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAARtOjo6DeJxODEA4cgbL6x-2pLhSBHSkw5S_etTpV0Zu&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPumpkin-Charlie-Translucent-Orange-Shaped%2Fdp%2FB09XSZN9K9)). 

Then there’s the fully manual option. Here, you’re solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and it’s one many purists prefer. 

### Preamp

The biggest decision you’ll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if you’d rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that you’re left with what the company provides from the factory, so if you’re looking to upgrade, you’ll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, there’s a switch that allows you to do this, so it’s no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere. 

A dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If you’re after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, we’d recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start.

### Removable cartridge/headshell

The next item you’ll want to consider is if the turntable you’re eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that don’t, so you’ll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp. 

### Belt drive vs. direct drive

There are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means there’s a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when you’re doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts.

### Counterweight and anti-skate control

Most turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components. 

### Other components to consider

Some final items you’ll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components.

## How we test turntables

Since most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of [Audio-Technica AT-SP3X](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0D6RM9BT9&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=c5aeffd4-6956-4f5a-99c5-d2f02da5c442&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Audio-Technica+AT-SP3X&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0F1ZGlvLVRlY2huaWNhLUFULVNQM1gtQm9va3NoZWxmLVNwZWFrZXJzL2RwL0IwRDZSTTlCVDk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzVhZWZmZDQtNjk1Ni00ZjVhLTk5YzUtZDJmMDJkYTVjNDQyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0F1ZGlvLVRlY2huaWNhLUFULVNQM1gtQm9va3NoZWxmLVNwZWFrZXJzL2RwL0IwRDZSTTlCVDkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAAWFmSOTmPB_kAtvAiOJOHydMxxtVhKIi3dFxts5gS4_u&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudio-Technica-AT-SP3X-Bookshelf-Speakers%2Fdp%2FB0D6RM9BT9) powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they won’t break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and they’ll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck.

For all of our test units that didn’t have a built-in preamp, we used the [Fluance PA-10](https://www.fluance.com/pa10-phono-turntable-preamplifier). At $100, it’s an affordable upgrade if you’re looking to bypass a turntable’s included components or if you’re looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if you’re using one) and you’re ready to go. It’s simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so it’s a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike. 

In terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels. Lastly, we take notes on design and components, comparing those elements from each turntable with our other test subjects to make our recommendations.
