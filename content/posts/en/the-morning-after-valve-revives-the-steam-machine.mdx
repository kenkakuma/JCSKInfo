Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. [Steam Frame](https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html) is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest.

At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) [Steam Machine](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html). This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick.

As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited _I would be_. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year. On one hand, the performance promises laid out here are fairly substantial but, on the other, this is also a company that sells the base model Steam Deck for less than a Switch 2.

That said, I would certainly get off the couch if there was a new Half-Life game in the works, and that seems plausible here. Nathan Ingraham is certainly getting his little hopes up that the revival of the Steam Machine [might see Valve revive something else](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valves-trio-of-hardware-announcements-revived-my-half-life-3-fever-dream-170000561.html) too.

### The new innovations aren’t hitting the spot.

I was a massive fan of Even Realities’ original smart glasses and was excited to see what [Sam Rutherford thought of their successor](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/even-realities-g2-first-look-this-years-best-looking-new-smart-glasses-still-need-work-151500132.html). Sadly, he was testing the specs with a beta version of the new software and found them lacking in several important ways. He’s urging folks to hold off buying these until the gaps in the software have all been filled in.

### What a shame the fan noise is so bad.

For years, the world has clamored for a modular, upgradeable gaming laptop offering the same longevity as a desktop. Now, Framework has achieved where so many have failed, selling an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 for its two-year-old Laptop 16. [I reviewed the new GPU (and CPU), and I’m blown away by it](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/framework-laptop-16-2025-upgrade-review-the-rtx-5070-is-the-star-160000464.html) — _quite literally_, thanks to the cooling issues that mean the fans are running at full speed whenever you put it under heavy load.

Apple is rolling out a Digital ID to its wallet that will, at some point in the near future, be legally accepted at TSA checkpoints. It’s [coming to more than 250 US airports](https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-introduces-a-new-digital-id-feature-to-make-boarding-flights-easier-175130213.html) and can eventually be used as your ID for domestic flights. But, you know, probably worth reading all of the details before you declare your paper passport a thing of the past.

### $250 gets you a lot of gear, including LiDAR.

Steve Dent for Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-2-review-the-best-budget-drone-is-now-even-better-120026045.html )

DJI’s Neo was good but not great — short battery life, noisy propellers and a lack of object avoidance all dulled its shine. Now, the [company’s successor has addressed all of those issues](https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-neo-2-review-the-best-budget-drone-is-now-even-better-120026045.html), leading our Steve Dent to call it “the best personal drone on the market.”
