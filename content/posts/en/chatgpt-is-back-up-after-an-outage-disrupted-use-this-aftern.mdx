If you had trouble using ChatGPT today, you aren't alone. The AI chatbot experienced a partial outage for many users this afternoon, with Down Detector saw reports reaching more than 12,000 reports around the peak point of the issue today.. OpenAI issued a status update shortly after noting that "elevated error rates" were occurring for ChatGPT and Platform users. That problem was marked as resolved at 5:14PM ET.

While the initial outage may be repaired, OpenAI does still have an active status alert up. It's only for the fine-tuning component of its API service. But the end may also be in sight for that final issue, because the current statement from the company is "We have applied the mitigation and are monitoring the recovering.

Another AI chatbot, Anthropic’s Claude, also experienced an outage today. It [listed](https://status.claude.com/incidents/pr6yx3bfr172) similar issues with "Elevated error rate on API across all Claude models." That status was resolved by 1PM ET.

**Update, February 3, 2025, 6:17PM ET:** Updated to reflect the change in status and mention Claude outage.
