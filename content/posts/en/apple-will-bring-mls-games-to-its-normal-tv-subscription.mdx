Apple is retiring its Major League Soccer Season Pass and including the next season of MLS [as part of its normal Apple TV subscription](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5b492e11-ee3b-4f9a-964c-0c22e8808b9a&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Apple&linkText=as+part+of+its+normal+Apple+TV+subscription&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8xMS9tYWpvci1sZWFndWUtc29jY2VyLWlzLWNvbWluZy10by1hcHBsZS10di1zdGFydGluZy1pbi0yMDI2LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWI0OTJlMTEtZWUzYi00ZjlhLTk2NGMtMGMyMmU4ODA4YjlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8xMS9tYWpvci1sZWFndWUtc29jY2VyLWlzLWNvbWluZy10by1hcHBsZS10di1zdGFydGluZy1pbi0yMDI2LyJ9&signature=AQAAAXwCxUF_w7H-GhaLxf5JZy6mPFMQilVdw22xzhgxIGLn&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F11%2Fmajor-league-soccer-is-coming-to-apple-tv-starting-in-2026%2F). Details of a new partnership agreement between Apple and MLS were first reported by [_The Athletic_](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6804777/2025/11/13/mls-apple-tv-end-paywall-season-pass/)_._ The arrangement appears to be similar to the one the company made in October to [bring F1 races to all subscribers](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-is-the-new-home-for-f1-racing-in-the-us-starting-in-2026-133619412.html).

Starting in 2026, all MLS games will be available to Apple TV subscribers. That includes regular season matches, and annual events like the Leagues Cup tournament, the MLS All-Star Game, the Campeones Cup and the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs.

First announced in 2022, the [MLS Season Pass](https://www.engadget.com/apple-mls-season-pass-price-release-date-173226971.html) remains one of Apple's most significant forays into sports programming to date. As part of its original agreement with MLS, Apple became the exclusive way soccer fans streamed MLS games globally, eliminating any kind of regional blackout as long as Apple TV was accessible. That level of access will now continue, without the need to pay $15 a month for MLS Season Pass. You just [need an Apple TV subscription](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/apple-tv-subscriptions-just-rose-to-13-a-month-150516370.html) to keep up with your favorite team.

"We're thrilled to bring MLS to more fans around the world next season on Apple TV," Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services, shared in the announcement. "Every match, all in one place, alongside incredible Apple Originals — it's a win for fans everywhere."

While Apple hasn't succeeded in locking down [NBA](https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html) or [NFL](https://www.engadget.com/youtube-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-155108503.html) games like its competitors Amazon and Google, the company has been slowly growing its sports ambitions. Apple's [Friday Night Baseball](https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball-181930932.html) streams now seem modest in comparison to what it's doing with the MLS and F1. The company's five-year F1 deal includes every Grand Prix race, along with practice, qualifying and sprint sessions. With the FIFA World Cup on the way in 2026, the company's new MLS deal is also impeccably timed.
