TikTok introduced a new "[bulletin board](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/introducing-bulletin-board?lang=en)" feature for creators that allows them to blast out updates directly to their followers' inboxes. The idea is similar to [broadcast channels](https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-rolling-out-its-telegram-like-broadcast-channels-worldwide-160815133.html) on Instagram or Telegram's one-way messaging feature. 

People who opt to join a creator's bulletin board will receive updates in their TikTok inbox. Updates can include text, links, polls or photos; as well as other TikTok posts or lives. Followers who join a board can react to messages but won't be able to comment or reply like a typical DM or post. According to TikTok, the feature could be especially useful for musicians and artists, as it allows them to share new songs and give fans a way to "pre-save" an upcoming release.

For creators with a large following, having a bulletin board could help streamline their ability to interact with fans without having to wade through an overloaded inbox or post separate video updates. It also gives them a way to get their work (including links to non-TikTok content) in front of their biggest fans without relying on the whims of the app's recommendation algorithm.  

Bulletin Board is available now to all creators over the age of 18 with 50,000 or more followers. TikTok users can find and join bulletin boards on creators' profiles.
