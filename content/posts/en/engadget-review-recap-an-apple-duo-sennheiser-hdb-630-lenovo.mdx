Techtober may have come to an end, but our [reviews](https://www.engadget.com/reviews/) team is still hard at work with this fall’s haul of new devices. Over the last two weeks, we’ve tested two new Apple products, a powerful gaming handheld, some seriously impressive headphones and Meta’s sporty smart glasses — and that’s just the start. Read on to catch up on all you might’ve missed, including our picks for the [best of 2025](https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-2025-114500543.html).

## Apple MacBook Pro M5 (14-inch)

When it comes to the new M5-powered MacBook Pro, the question isn’t whether it’s a capable machine or not. The real dilemma is whether to buy now or wait for even more muscle from the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. “If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip),” [senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar explained](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html). “But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.”

## Sennheiser HDB 630

Sennheiser uses a USB-C dongle to bridge the gap between wireless convenience and audiophile-grade sound quality with the HDB 630. The problem is they don’t really look like a set of high-end headphones and the $500 asking price is steep. “As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone,” [I wrote](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sennheiser-hdb-630-review-a-sonic-marvel-with-room-for-improvement-150000295.html). “If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.”

## Lenovo Legion Go 2

Sometimes it’s better to have a utility player instead of a specialist. According to senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford, that’s exactly what you get with Lenovo’s Legion Go 2. You encounter great performance from a device with a huge 8.8-inch OLED display, but the handheld is expensive and bulky. “Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show,” [he said](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html). “While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.”

## Apple iPad Pro M5 (13-inch)

The M5 iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also entirely too expensive. While the new chip offers a sizable upgrade, the screen is excellent and fast charging has finally hit the iPad, this model also requires you to spend more on accessories. “Unless you are going to use it as your main computer — all day, every day — and know exactly what benefits you’ll get from the iPad over a more traditional laptop, you’re probably better off buying an iPad Air and saving yourself a lot of money,” [deputy news editor Nathan Ingraham wrote](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-pro-m5-review-speed-boost-130046249.html).

## Oakley Meta Vanguard

Meta’s sportier collab with Oakley has arrived, with a slew of features that might convince you to replace your action cam with a set of smart glasses. “If you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or \[insert outdoor activity of your choice\], there's a lot to like,” [senior reporter Karissa Bell said](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html). “The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share.”

## Other recent reviews

In other reviews, deputy buying advice editor Valentina Palladino put the slightly updated [Powerbeats Fit](https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/beats-powerbeats-fit-review-deja-vu-in-a-good-way-120058332.html) through their paces and senior reporter Igor Bonifacic went on a gaming spree with the [Fractal Design Scape](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/fractal-design-scape-review-a-stellar-debut-173000007.html). Igor also spent some time with the [Galaxy S25 FE](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-review-iterative-to-a-fault-183026577.html) and I test drove Amazon’s completely rebuilt [Echo Studio](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html). Senior writer Sam Chapman compiled a list of the [best free VPNs](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html) and published an in-depth review of [Private Internet Access VPN](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html).
