A few days ago, a Redditor [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/?share_id=-Q9fJkDiV5VLbNB2mHnnT) in the community for DoorDash drivers that they received an offer to close a Waymo vehicle’s door. The job paid a guaranteed fee of $6.25 with a $5 extra on top of it after the DoorDasher verifies that it has been completed. Waymo has confirmed to [_404Media_](https://www.404media.co/waymo-is-getting-doordashers-to-close-doors-on-self-driving-cars/) and [_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/) that, yes, it is indeed paying Dashers to shut the doors of its self-driving cars. And it makes sense because, well, there’s nobody to do it otherwise if a passenger accidentally leaves it open.

The Alphabet subsidiary and DoorDash told the publications that it’s currently running a pilot program in [Atlanta](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-and-uber-launch-robotaxi-service-in-atlanta-110056091.html), wherein if one of its vehicle’s doors is left ajar, nearby Dashers are notified. Waymo’s self-driving vehicles can’t leave if one of its doors remains open, so the company is framing the program as a way to enhance its fleet’s efficiency. Waymo told _404Media_ that the program started earlier this year and that payments are structured to ensure “competitive and fair compensation for Dashers.”

To note, this isn’t the first time the two companies have teamed up. In October 2025, Waymo’s self-driving cars [became a delivery option](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-will-also-drive-for-doordash-in-phoenix-213535127.html) for DoorDash customers in Phoenix, Arizona. To get a Waymo delivery, customers will have to choose “opt in to autonomous delivery” during checkout and to physically retrieve their order from the car’s trunk when it arrives.
