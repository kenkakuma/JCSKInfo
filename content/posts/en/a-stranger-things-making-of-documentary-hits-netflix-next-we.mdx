Netflix just announced the pending release of a [_Stranger Things_ documentary](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2a170a1e-7e5c-4edd-b5dd-ea6d3bd9416a&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ed8b1ca5-e18f-44a6-a064-6d16f8479f21&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Netflix&linkText=Stranger+Things+documentary&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXRmbGl4LmNvbS90dWR1bS92aWRlb3Mvb25lLWxhc3QtYWR2ZW50dXJlLXRoZS1tYWtpbmctb2Ytc3RyYW5nZXItdGhpbmdzLTUtdHJhaWxlciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWQ4YjFjYTUtZTE4Zi00NGE2LWEwNjQtNmQxNmY4NDc5ZjIxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXRmbGl4LmNvbS90dWR1bS92aWRlb3Mvb25lLWxhc3QtYWR2ZW50dXJlLXRoZS1tYWtpbmctb2Ytc3RyYW5nZXItdGhpbmdzLTUtdHJhaWxlciJ9&signature=AQAAAeeWwFLCMtPvvzF_KfrgONAxayx-HBv7xtZG1txgYEzz&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftudum%2Fvideos%2Fone-last-adventure-the-making-of-stranger-things-5-trailer), hot on the heels of the [series finale](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-released-a-trailer-for-the-stranger-things-finale-171204480.html). It premieres on January 12. _One Last Adventure_ focuses on the making of season five, so it's not a full series retrospective. This seems similar to what Disney+ does a few weeks after a popular Star Wars or Marvel show drops.

Still, it's a documentary about the very last season of the show, so there's likely to be some tearful goodbyes and all of that jazz. As a matter of fact, the trailer shows plenty of hugs along with sit-down interviews.

It'll shine a light on how some of the stunts and set pieces came together, which is cool. _Stranger Things_, after all, is primarily a show about spectacle and season five had plenty to spare. The Duffer Brothers will also discuss how they came to write some of those final character arcs (no spoilers here.)

If you're grieving the loss of Steve Harrington, Delightful Derrick, Eleven and the rest, this should make for a nice watch. It's worth noting that while _Stranger Things_ has doled out its last needle drop, the franchise itself is still going. 

The animated spinoff _Stranger Things: Tales From '85_ [premieres later this year](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-trailer-for-the-animated-stranger-things-spin-off-is-here-172128527.html). There's also a live-action spinoff coming at some point. This will likely be [another story in the same universe](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/article/what-we-know-about-the-stranger-things-spinoff--plus-a-key-detail-in-the-series-finale-220738652.html).
