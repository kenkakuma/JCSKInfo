If your Gmail inbox is all out of whack today, you're not alone. Gmail users have been encountering issues with the automatic filters that keep their main inbox free from the clutter of promotional emails and non-urgent updates, and some have reported seeing notices that emails have not been scanned for spam. Google confirmed to Engadget and in an update on its [Workspace status dashboard](https://www.google.com/appsstatus/dashboard/incidents/NNnDkY9CJ36annsfytjQ) that it's aware of the problems, and is currently working on a fix. 

On social media and [DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/), some Gmail users have also reported delays in receiving messages, leading to issues with two-factor authentication logins. Google noted that the problem has resulted in the "misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings," including a banner that says, “Be careful with this message. Gmail hasn't scanned this message for spam, unverified senders, or harmful software.” In a statement to Engadget, a Google spokesperson echoed the message from its status dashboard, saying, "We are actively working to resolve the issue. As always, we encourage users to follow standard best practices when engaging with messages from unknown senders."
