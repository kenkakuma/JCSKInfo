If vacuuming is your least favorite chore, employing a robot vacuum can save you time and stress while also making sure your home stays clean. While once most robo-vacs landed on the higher end of the price spectrum, that’s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.  
  
Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker with serious cleaning chops for $500 — sometimes even $300 or less. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection. After testing dozens of [robot vacuums at various price points](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html), I’ve narrowed down our top picks for the best budget robot vacuums you can buy right now.

## **Best budget robot vacuums for 2026**

## Are robot vacuums worth it?

Since I've tested dozens of robot vacuums, I'm often asked if these gadgets are "worth it" and I'd say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance.

There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair.

When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places.

## What to look for in a budget robot vacuum

When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums.

So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you're dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance.

You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range.

Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it.

You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules.

But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option.

Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes.

## How we test robot vacuums

When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more.

Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris.

## Robot vacuum maintenance tips

First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it's ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides.

In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean.

Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like [Amazon](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B016UG1YVQ&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Amazon&custData=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&signature=AQAAAbia_CCrFkNcgJ0zQ7ebgrU4mGP5Uw4OzoYjaSwMhcJw&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fclean-Replacement-iRobot-Robotic-Cleaning%2Fdp%2FB016UG1YVQ%2F) or [Walmart](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&itemId=walmart_transaction_121788585&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=2efe7003-0f06-49dd-bf75-650fb81c222c&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Walmart&linkText=Walmart&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9OZXV0b3AtSEVQQS1GaWx0ZXItUmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS1pUm9ib3QtUm9vbWJhLTgwMC05MDAtU2VyaWVzLTg1MC04NjAtODcwLTg3Ny04ODAtODkwLTg5MS04MDEtODA1LTk2MC05ODAtOTgxLTk4NS1Sb2JvdC1WYWN1dW1zLTktUGFjay8xMjE3ODg1ODU_ZnJvbT0vc2VhcmNoIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWZlNzAwMy0wZjA2LTQ5ZGQtYmY3NS02NTBmYjgxYzIyMmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL2lwL05ldXRvcC1IRVBBLUZpbHRlci1SZXBsYWNlbWVudC1Db21wYXRpYmxlLWlSb2JvdC1Sb29tYmEtODAwLTkwMC1TZXJpZXMtODUwLTg2MC04NzAtODc3LTg4MC04OTAtODkxLTgwMS04MDUtOTYwLTk4MC05ODEtOTg1LVJvYm90LVZhY3V1bXMtOS1QYWNrLzEyMTc4ODU4NT9mcm9tPS9zZWFyY2gifQ&signature=AQAAAR0fvhpjAgri6zot6u_Z0ys9xKbrrvArCJmjNE70pBiJ&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNeutop-HEPA-Filter-Replacement-Compatible-iRobot-Roomba-800-900-Series-850-860-870-877-880-890-891-801-805-960-980-981-985-Robot-Vacuums-9-Pack%2F121788585%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch).

## Budget robot vacuum FAQs

### Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair?

Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a [cordless vacuum](https://www.engadget.com/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html) since those tend to be more powerful overall.

### How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge?

Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power.

### Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors?

Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors.

### Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features?

Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you're thinking of buying and look for "smart mapping" or "smart home mapping" in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.
