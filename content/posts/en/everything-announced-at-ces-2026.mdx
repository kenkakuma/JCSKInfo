It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because [CES 2026](https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/) is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. 

Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung has already held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology.

You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos that are being shown off at the event) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week. 

## Micro RGB TVs 

![Samsung&#39;s 130-inch Micro RGB TV.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Samsung_Micro_RGB-1.jpg)

Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV.

Devindra Hardawar for Engadget

Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. [Read our explainer](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html) for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.

We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a [mammoth 130-inch concept model](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html) that [Samsung brought to Las Vegas](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html). The company [unveiled](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html) its first Micro RGB TV in August, — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.

LG revealed its first [Micro RGB set](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html) at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG [showed off its latest Wallpaper TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-brought-back-the-wallpaper-tv-for-ces-and-ditched-the-companion-sound-bar-030057927.html), which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's [new Gallery TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-tvs-at-ces-2026-a-stunning-wallpaper-set-glorious-micro-rgb-colors-and-a-better-gallery-tv-033739600.html) — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.

## Other new TVs and OS updates

![Ember Artline TV.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/877150a0-e683-11f0-82fe-0fd2cae385ac)

Ember Artline TV.

Amazon

We’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that scene with the [Ember Artline TV](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/ember-artline-is-amazons-answer-to-samsungs-the-frame-150015104.html). The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room.

It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.

![The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/New-Fire-TV-UI.jpg)

The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.

Amazon

Speaking of Fire TV, Amazon has [revamped the platform’s user interface](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/amazon-is-redesigning-its-fire-tv-ui-for-streaming-sticks-and-tvs-150000622.html) with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the Fire TV OS will deliver speed boosts of up to 20 to 30 percent. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.

On the Google side of TV land, you can expect [more Gemini-powered features](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tv-is-getting-gemini-powered-photo-editing-at-ces-140000172.html). The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s [hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/google-tvs-new-gemini-features-range-from-useful-to-unnecessary-222900001.html).

## Samsung

![Samsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/69776940-e9f8-11f0-afca-02ae016f217d)

Samsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.

Billy Steele for Engadget

Samsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the leadup to the event, it announced its [two new soundbars](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html) (we're had some hands-on time [with one of those](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-hw-qs90h-soundbar-hands-on-impressive-bass-performance-without-a-subwoofer-045727939.html)), the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've [got some IRL impressions of those](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-music-studio-5-and-7-hands-on-unique-speaker-designs-debut-at-ces-2026-052009007.html)), [a bunch of monitors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html), the refreshed [FreeStyle+ projector](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html) ([we've checked that out too](https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-freestyle-plus-projector-hands-on-ces-2026-060840386.html)). It also announced plans to [bring Google Photos to TVs](https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html).

At the [First Look showcase](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsung-first-look-at-ces-2026-the-biggest-announcements-from-the-years-first-press-conference-230059466.html) on Sunday, Samsung talked up "AI experiences everywhere. For everyone" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. 

First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.

Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.

## LG

![LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg)

LG&#39;s CLOiD robot.

LG

Likewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES. The company is shining the spotlight on its [CLOiD robot.](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-reveals-its-laundry-folding-robot-at-ces-2026-215121021.html) Like the far creepier-looking [1X Neo](https://www.engadget.com/ai/1x-neo-is-a-20000-home-robot-that-will-learn-chores-via-teleoperation-040252200.html), the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person this week.

The company also debuted the [LG Sound Suite](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/dolby-and-lg-introduce-a-modular-home-audio-system-for-ces-2026-010000126.html), a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of [xboom speakers](https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html) as well as some [monitors](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html) and [ultralight Gram laptops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lgs-aerominum-gram-pro-laptops-feel-impossibly-light-and-strong-200317743.html) that are made with a material it's calling [Aerominum](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html). 

## Lego

![Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SMARTBrick_16x9.jpg)

Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.

Lego

In its [first CES appearance](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/follow-the-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-right-here-130005940.html), Lego announced the [Smart Brick](https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html), a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.

Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. It all seems very neat and I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with these Smart Bricks.

The first “[Smart Play](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&featureId=text-link&merchantName=LEGO&linkText=Smart+Play&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play)” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and _The Imperial March_.

## The chipmakers

![NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/jensen-huang.gif)

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.

NVIDIA

It's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means [NVIDIA](https://www.engadget.com/computing/watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-keynote-with-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here-ai-robotics-updates-and-more-130028170.html), [Intel](https://www.engadget.com/computing/intel-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-core-ultra-series-3-panther-lake-launch-event-130040881.html), [AMD](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-ceo-lisa-sus-keynote-presentation-190012370.html) and Qualcomm are all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.

Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was laregly a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have [some news to share](https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html).

NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios. The company also revealed that a super computer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture NVIDIA unveiled in 2024 is in production.

![As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/1833e610-ea90-11f0-bfbe-ac3772d5afe3)

Intel at CES 2026

Sam Chapman for Engadget

Things haven’t exactly been going great for Intel for a while, but the company is surely hoping that its [Core Ultra Series 3 chips](https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html) can help it right the ship. These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops.

The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cors, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.

![A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/8b508280-eaa8-11f0-bffb-7903d4a9ed90)

A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.

AMD

Of course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several [CPUs](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-new-ryzen-ai-max-chips-and-ryzen-7-9850x3d-court-desktop-enthusiasts-at-ces-2026-033000587.html) for [laptops and desktops](https://www.engadget.com/computing/amds-ryzen-ai-400-chips-are-a-big-boost-for-laptops-and-desktops-alike-033000635.html), while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.”

![Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation &quot;X2.&quot;](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HERO_Image_Snapdragon_X2_Plus.png)

Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board.

Qualcomm

And then there’s [Qualcomm](https://www.engadget.com/computing/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x2-plus-chip-at-ces-170000392.html). The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. It’s more of a mid-range chip that isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the last generation.

## Laptops and desktops

![Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on](https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9e798a0-ea85-11f0-bbd1-8dfc40a2d49e)

Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series

Mat Smith for Engadget

What would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. We’d already seen LG’s new ultrathin laptops in advance of CES, while Samsung had some of its own to show off.

The Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read [our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html) for the specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.

Dell realized it [messed up](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-killing-the-xps-name-is-an-unforced-error-200006195.html) by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. [A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html), including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.

![On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg)

On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.

We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint by bringing the [ROG Zephyrus Duo](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-is-big-weird-and-kind-of-awesome-000000156.html) to CES. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.

## L'Oreal

![A pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Loreal-LED-Eye-Mask-6.jpg)

A pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.

L'Oréal

L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a [trio of gadgets](https://www.engadget.com/science/loreals-ces-2026-beauty-devices-include-a-skin-like-flexible-led-mask-070000576.html). The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.

The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's only in prototype form for now and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. 

The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It's said to have sensors that employ "built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning" so they can adapt to your gestures and "maximize individual experience." L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation "effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F." You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.

## Mobile

Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a [physical keyboard phone accessory](https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html) from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can [reserve one now](https://www.clicksphone.com/communicator) for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.

As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150 mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can [lock in a pre-order](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html) for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.

![Marketing image of the Punkt MC03 phone. A dark UI shows text shortcuts for common apps and tasks.](https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/punkt.jpg)

The Punkt MC03 phone.

Punkt

Those who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The [MC03](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/minimal-phone-pioneer-punkt-is-back-with-a-new-privacy-focused-model-at-ces-110000705.html) is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then it's a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).

## Charging tech

![undefined](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/24641140-db80-11f0-b7d7-4b9d7391fd44)

Anker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a [refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkin-charging-case-for-the-switch-2-ces-2026-screen-for-checking-battery-life-170029146.html) that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on.

Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and it will ship later this year.

## AI

Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.

Amazon

No prizes for guessing that there's going to be a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's [rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-rolling-out-alexa-for-the-web-so-you-can-use-its-assistant-without-a-dedicated-device-150053826.html). That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.

There are a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The [Sweekar](https://www.engadget.com/ai/sweekar-turns-the-tamagotchi-into-a-physical-ai-pocket-pet-that-wont-die-on-you-023525228.html) will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it "returns." Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the  Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.

We also saw the [Fraimic](https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/fraimic-is-an-e-ink-display-that-turns-your-ideas-into-ai-art-120000454.html), an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic (which costs $399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping in this spring.

Some companies still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the [AI MindClip](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/switchbot-turned-up-to-ces-with-an-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say-014959824.html), which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Plaid, meanwhile, brought its [NotePin follow up](https://www.engadget.com/ai/watch-out-theres-a-new-ai-pin-in-town-that-can-transcribe-all-your-conversations-153131281.html) to the dance. This time around, the [NotePin S](https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html) has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing.

## Robots

Boston Dynamics

Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s [latest model](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-announces-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047772.html) is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. 

Per a [press release](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/boston-dynamics-google-deepmind-form-new-ai-partnership/), the partnership "will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry." As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.

## Gaming

8BitDo FlipPad

8BitDo

The [FlipPad](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdo-is-unveiling-a-new-mobile-gaming-pad-at-ces-134555603.html) is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of [neat physical controllers for phones](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html) that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. And that’s not to mention emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. The company also [unveiled a new Xbox controller](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdos-ultimate-3e-gamepad-for-xbox-offers-swappable-button-modules-and-joysticks-160011248.html) with swappable joysticks and button modules.
