There's a new AAA John Wick game coming with Keanu Reaves portraying the main character both in voice and likeness, Lionsgate and Saber Interactive [announced](https://saber.games/blog/2026/02/12/johnwickvideogame/). Currently untitled, it's in development for PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC, and will be a single-player third-person experience designed for "mature" audiences. So far, there's no release date. 

"The new single-player third-person action game will combine _John Wick_’s unparalleled, adrenaline-fueled 'gun-fu' fighting style with Saber’s proven reputation for creating thrilling gaming experiences that leave players craving more," the companies said in an announcement post. They added that franchise director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves are both involved in the game’s production, with Reeves reprising his character's look, voice and more. 

The story is original and "addresses a significant time in John Wick's life," according to the game's director Jesus Iglesias. It will include both familiar film characters and new ones created for the game. As for gameplay, it will offer "a hard-hitting gun-fu combat system, jaw-dropping camerawork, intense driving experiences, cinematic storytelling, and a bold range of atmospherically immersive environments," the team said.

Saber Interactive is the developer behind _Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2_ and is also developing the upcoming titles _Jurassic Park: Survival_ and _John Carpenter's Toxic Commando_. It will be the first John Wick game since _John Wick Hex_, which [came out in 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-john-wick-hex-bithell-games-review.html) but was recently [delisted](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/john-wick-hex-will-be-delisted-from-all-platforms-on-july-17-123028996.html).
