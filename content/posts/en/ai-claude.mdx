Anthropic announced Tuesday that its Claude AI assistant now integrates directly with Microsoft 365, marking a significant expansion in enterprise AI deployment as companies increasingly embed artificial intelligence into daily productivity workflows.

The integration, launched October 15, enables Claude users to access real-time data from Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and SharePoint through a new connector built on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol. Users can now ask Claude to analyze email threads, summarize Teams conversations, and retrieve documents without manually uploading files.​

**Enterprise Search Transforms Workplace AI**

The centerpiece of Tuesday's announcement is Claude's new enterprise search capability, which creates a centralized knowledge hub across connected business applications. The feature allows Claude to pull information from HR documents, internal communications, and team guidelines to deliver comprehensive responses to organizational queries.​

"When you ask Claude a question, it can search across your company's connected data sources in one place, so you get answers that draw from your organization's collective knowledge, not just your own files," Anthropic explained in its blog post.​

The integration requires administrator approval before individual users can authenticate their accounts, with enterprise search available immediately for all Claude Team and Enterprise customers.​

**Strategic Shift in AI Partnership Landscape**

The launch comes as Microsoft diversifies its AI strategy beyond its primary partnership with OpenAI. In September, Microsoft began offering Anthropic's Claude models as alternatives to OpenAI's technology in Microsoft 365 Copilot's Researcher feature and Copilot Studio.​

This move follows Anthropic's recent $13 billion funding round that valued the company at $183 billion, positioning it as the fourth-most valuable private company globally. The San Francisco-based startup, founded by former OpenAI executives, now serves over 300,000 business customers with annual revenue exceeding $5 billion.​

The enterprise AI assistant market is projected to expand from $3.35 billion in 2025 to $21.11 billion by 2030, driven by demand for role-specific AI solutions embedded within existing workflows.​
