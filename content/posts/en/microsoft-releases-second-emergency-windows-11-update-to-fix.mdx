Microsoft issued another out-of-band update to fix a bug that caused [Outlook](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-outlook-free-to-use-for-mac-201328421.html) to crash for Windows 11 users. This second [emergency patch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-25h2#2738msgdesc) addresses issues seen with Outlook and files stored in the cloud following Microsoft's January 2026 Windows security update.

According to Microsoft, this update fixes a bug where some apps that "open or save files stored in cloud-backed locations" became unresponsive or displayed error messages. Some users also experienced Outlook crashing or not opening when PST files are stored in cloud-based options like OneDrive.

This is the second time this year that Microsoft had to issue a last-minute fix for bugs related to its January security update. [Last week](https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-issues-emergency-fix-afer-a-security-update-left-some-windows-11-devices-unable-to-shut-down-192216734.html), some Windows 11 devices couldn't shut down or hibernate, while other devices running Windows 10 or 11 couldn't log in through remote connections. For more context, Microsoft only issues out-of-band updates when there's a serious issue that can't wait until its regular update cycle. Fortunately, the latest out-of-band update is cumulative, so you only need to download and install this one to fix the issues seen with the January update.
