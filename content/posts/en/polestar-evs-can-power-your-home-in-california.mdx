EV maker Polestar [has announced](https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/694819) that it's bringing bi-directional charging — the ability for an electric car to be tapped as a battery for your home or the grid — to [Polestar 3](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-3-first-drive-the-long-awaited-suv-is-finally-here-and-its-good-154552543.html) owners who live in California. The feature is one of several ways EV owners can save money with their electric car, by either using less energy overall, or receiving credits for providing their excess power to the grid.

Polestar's bi-directional charging feature uses direct current, according to the company, and enables "V2H functionality for Polestar 3 customers on the 400 Volt electrical architecture." Polestar is offering the feature in partnership with home energy company [dcbel](https://www.dcbel.energy/), who helps administer a California Energy Commission program for installing "home energy stations" that can manage multiple clean energy sources in residential homes, including EVs with bi-directional charging. Polestar claims that using dcbel's Ara system, customers can "reduce charging costs by up to $1,300 per year and use their car as an energy backup during blackouts for up to 10 days."

The ability to send excess charge from an EV battery back into your home was originally a major selling point of [Ford's F-150 Lighting](https://www.engadget.com/ford-bidirectional-ev-charging-f-150-lightning-180545711.html). Bi-directional charging has also shown up on [GM's EV lineup](https://www.engadget.com/gm-will-enable-vehicle-to-home-charging-on-all-ultium-based-evs-164248583.html) and the [third-generation Nissan Leaf](https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nissan-unveils-the-third-generation-leaf-ev-145620303.html). Polestar says it'll continue the development of the bi-directional charging capabilities of its cars and "plans to introduce a wider offer in the future." While this partnership is the first time the EV maker is offering the charging feature in the US, Polestar already offers bi-directional charging to customers in Germany via a home charger it developed with Zaptec.

If you live in California and own a Polestar 3, you can apply for rebates on a home energy station at [dcbel's website](https://polestar.dcbel.energy/) so you can try the feature for yourself.
