A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for [Proton VPN](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234) is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month.

That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180.

Proton VPN is our pick for the [best VPN overall](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html) because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection [might not be fast enough](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html) for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices.

The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet).

Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.

Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday [VPN deal](https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-88-percent-discounts-on-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056913.html) this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN.

*   [**Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off):**](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6119f7ca-bf13-40ba-b3f6-2a335a8890f6&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5965d45f-7ac3-419f-bd32-e45f337f775e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=surfshark&linkText=Surfshark+One+%2824+months+%2B+3+free+months%29+for+%2459.13+%2888+percent+off%29%3A&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cmZzaGFyay5jb20vcHJpY2luZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTk2NWQ0NWYtN2FjMy00MTlmLWJkMzItZTQ1ZjMzN2Y3NzVlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cmZzaGFyay5jb20vcHJpY2luZyJ9&signature=AQAAAQTwxT7ieoTcnocx6IyPKQ5KLlpzJ_kJICcSeWT6rkCD&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2Fpricing) A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features.
    
*   [**NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off):**](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5965d45f-7ac3-419f-bd32-e45f337f775e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=NordVPN&linkText=NordVPN+Plus+%2824+months+%2B+3+free+months%29+for+%24105.03+%2874+percent+off%29%3A&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL3ByaWNpbmcvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1OTY1ZDQ1Zi03YWMzLTQxOWYtYmQzMi1lNDVmMzM3Zjc3NWUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbm9yZHZwbi5jb20vcHJpY2luZy8ifQ&signature=AQAAAauQSV3fiv5TlUzk_bVvFBqsDiG9HA_sW6ai1xd_hRTU&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fpricing%2F) NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information.
    
*   [**CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off):**](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5965d45f-7ac3-419f-bd32-e45f337f775e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=CyberGhost&linkText=CyberGhost+%2824+months+%2B+4+free+months%29+for+%2456.94+%2884+percent+off%29%3A&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9idXkvY3liZXJnaG9zdC12cG4tMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTk2NWQ0NWYtN2FjMy00MTlmLWJkMzItZTQ1ZjMzN2Y3NzVlIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jeWJlcmdob3N0dnBuLmNvbS9idXkvY3liZXJnaG9zdC12cG4tMyJ9&signature=AQAAAS2eX6OQ9X4M1HlE77a-uPurwNv61T43EG3bo_Df9Rf-&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fbuy%2Fcyberghost-vpn-3) CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites.
    
*   [**Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off):**](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b0732cc-efc2-4542-849d-cadc641525e2&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=5965d45f-7ac3-419f-bd32-e45f337f775e&featureId=text-link&merchantName=private+internet+access&linkText=Private+Internet+Access+%2836+months+%2B+4+free+months%29+for+%2479.20+%2883+percent+off%29%3A&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcml2YXRlaW50ZXJuZXRhY2Nlc3MuY29tL2J1eS12cG4tb25saW5lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1OTY1ZDQ1Zi03YWMzLTQxOWYtYmQzMi1lNDVmMzM3Zjc3NWUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByaXZhdGVpbnRlcm5ldGFjY2Vzcy5jb20vYnV5LXZwbi1vbmxpbmUifQ&signature=AQAAAVjdUJGtF6-pc1OxmEmc_PUd2HRdiEhQ-Om-xdSggLML&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fbuy-vpn-online) [Private Internet Access (PIA)](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/private-internet-access-vpn-review-both-more-and-less-than-a-budget-vpn-120033882.html) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.
