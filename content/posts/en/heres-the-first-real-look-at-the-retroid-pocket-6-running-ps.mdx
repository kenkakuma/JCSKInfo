The [Retroid Pocket 6](https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-6-handheld) may have gotten off to a rocky start, but the gaming handheld is officially completed and going to see its first shipments soon. The handheld maker revealed the final product shots of the Retroid Pocket 6 in black and orange [on X](https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/2004504958448832985). Along with in-person product pics, Retroid revealed [gameplay videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wFxb3uMo_o) of its handheld, running emulation of PlayStation 2 games.

For those looking to relive some classic Nintendo or PlayStation titles, the Retroid Pocket 6 offers a great entry point into the retro handheld world since it can emulate games up to Nintendo Switch and PS2. However, Retroid did have some initial blowback about its design and decided to go back to the drawing board. Following the early criticisms, Retroid decided to add an option for customers to choose between having the D-pad or a thumbstick at the top of the handheld's left side.

The problems persisted for Retroid, as the handheld maker had to then cut short the early bird pricing thanks to the [widespread memory shortage](https://www.engadget.com/ai/there-arent-any-black-friday-deals-on-ram-this-year-and-you-can-thank-ai-for-that-130000335.html). Instead of offering the handheld for $209 until January, Retroid removed the discount in late December, leaving new buyers paying the full retail price of $229. However, the internal specs remained the same, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 12GB of memory and up to 256GB of storage that's expandable with a TF card slot.

Despite the hiccups, Retroid looks ready to start shipments of its latest retro gaming handheld as evidenced by the new photos and videos. According to the website, the first batch of Retroid Pocket 6 preorders are due to start shipping in January. Second bath preoders are still available on Retroid's website, which are expected to get to customers in March.
