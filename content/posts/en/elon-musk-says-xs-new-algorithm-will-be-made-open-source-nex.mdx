X may soon provide more insight into how its algorithm works. On Saturday, Elon Musk posted on the platform to say that the company "will make the new X algorithm, including all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users, open source in 7 days." 

X's recommendation algorithm has been the [subject of investigations by France](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/france-launches-criminal-probe-of-xs-alleged-algorithm-manipulation-123017920.html) [and the European Commission](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eu-wants-to-know-just-how-xs-recommendation-algorithm-works-161000963.html), the latter of which [recently extended](https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-commission-has-ordered-x-retain-all-grok-documents-until-end-2026-2026-01-08/) through 2026 a retention order that it sent to the company at the beginning of last year. And scrutiny into the platform, along with demands for accountability, have only increased after its chatbot, Grok, was caught [generating CSAM at users' requests](https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html) and continues to be [used to digitally undress women](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/08/grok-x-nonconsensual-images) nonconsensually.

Elon Musk's X post about open-sourcing the algorithm.

Musk has been making promises of open-sourcing the algorithm since his takeover of Twitter, and in 2023 published the code for the site's "For You" feed on GitHub. But the code wasn't all that revealing, leaving out key details, [according to analyses at the time](https://www.engadget.com/what-did-twitters-open-source-algorithm-actually-reveal-not-a-lot-194652809.html). And it hasn't been kept up to date. Of the making the new algorithm open source, Musk said in his post, "This will be repeated every 4 weeks, with comprehensive developer notes, to help you understand what changed."
