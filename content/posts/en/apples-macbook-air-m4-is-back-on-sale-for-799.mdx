This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It's available in multiple colorways, but the silver one inexplicably costs $899.

We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the [best MacBook computers](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-macbook-140032524.html). Heck, it's even our [very favorite laptop](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html). Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work.

The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness.

This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already [released the MacBook Pro M5](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html), so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.
