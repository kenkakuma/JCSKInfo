Ayaneo may be working on more [affordable gaming handhelds](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-premium-handheld-from-ayaneos-budget-brand-arrives-in-september-183533792.html) lately, but it hasn't forgotten how to do the extravagant designs that the handheld maker is known for. One-upping the bulky [Legion Go 2](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html), Ayaneo announced its latest Windows handheld called the [Next II](https://www.ayaneo.com/article/905).

Ayaneo is continuing the theme for its Next lineup of devices, making these handhelds as big and powerful as possible. The Next II packs a 9.06-inch OLED display with a 2,400 x 1,504 resolution and a variable refresh rate that can be adjusted between 60 and 165 Hz. Ayaneo's latest premium handheld should handle any game you throw at it thanks to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and a massive 115 Wh battery. The company didn't reveal any battery life estimates yet, but it's unlikely we'll see all-day usage with these high-end specs.

To match the powerful internal components, Ayaneo equipped the Next II with Hall effect joysticks and triggers to prevent deadzones and stick drift. Borrowing from its previous high-end handheld called the [Ayaneo Kun](https://www.engadget.com/pre-orders-for-ayaneos-kun-gaming-handheld-start-september-5-204517180.html), the Next II also features dual smart touchpads that can be customized with gesture controls and key mapping. The back of the handheld is home to four extra buttons, but you can also set specific controls for four other customizable buttons.

Ayaneo hasn't revealed any pricing details yet, but the Next II might be reserved for those willing to spend closer to $2,000. Don't forget that Ayaneo's previous flagship handheld, the [Ayaneo Kun](https://www.engadget.com/ayaneos-kun-gaming-handheld-review-164050984.html), could be fully kitted out for a $1,700 price tag.
