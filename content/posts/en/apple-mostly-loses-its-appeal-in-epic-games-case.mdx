Apple has clawed back a bit of ground in its legal fight with Epic Games that could have wide-reaching consequences for all app developers. Today, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly [upheld](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/12/11/25-2935.pdf) a previous contempt ruling regarding fees Apple levied on third-party payment systems. However, the judges did decide to reverse the order that Apple cannot charge any commissions on those external payments, which was one of the company's main arguments in this ongoing debate.   

To catch you up, US Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers initially ruled [in 2021](https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html) that Apple must allow third-party payment systems, although her decision fell shy of calling the tech company's control over the App Store a monopoly. In [May 2025](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/court-orders-apple-to-stop-collecting-fees-for-purchases-made-outside-the-app-store-110036376.html), she ruled that Apple's 27 percent commission on those outside payments violated her previous order. Apple responded with [an emergency motion](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-files-emergency-hold-to-challenge-app-store-payment-injunction-123030879.html) to appeal that finding. 

Epic Games had taken its smash hit Fortnite off both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while it was in court arguing these cases. Fortnite returned [to iOS](https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fortnite-is-finally-back-in-the-us-app-store-222946133.html) in the spring and just arrived back [on Android](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/fortnite-is-back-on-the-google-play-store-195507458.html) devices today.
