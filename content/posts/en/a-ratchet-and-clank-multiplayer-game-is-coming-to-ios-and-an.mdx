It’s been four years since the wonderful [_Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart_](https://www.engadget.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-interview-ps5-151025038.html) and, especially given the rate at which developer Insomniac churns out great games, I had hoped we wouldn’t have to wait too much longer for another installment of the long-running action platformer series. As it turns out, there is a new Ratchet & Clank game coming soon, just not on PS5.

_Ratchet & Clank: Ranger Rumble_ is a “fast-paced” multiplayer arena shooter that’s coming to iOS and Android soon. In fact, according to [the game’s website](https://www.rangerrumble.com/), it’s already available in select countries. Folks in other locales who are interested can pre-register.

Mobile developer Oh BiBi took the reins from Insomniac for this one. There are still platforming elements in _Ranger Rumble._ It looks quite colorful and you’ll have a variety of weapons, abilities and characters at your disposal. There are several game modes, including a soccer-style one. _Ranger Rumble_ is free-to-play, though it will likely have microtransactions. For what it’s worth, you’ll be able to customize your characters.

This isn’t the first time that the Ratchet & Clank series has made its way to mobile. _Ratchet & Clank: Going Mobile_ debuted in 2005, before the arrival of iPhone and Android devices. Endless runner _Before the Nexus_ [arrived eight years later](https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-20-ratchet-and-clank-before-the-nexus-companion-game-out-now-on-ios.html).

A sequel to _Going Mobile_ called _Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home_ was originally slated to hit Java phones in 2006 before it was canceled. However, dedicated fans found a phone that had a copy of the game on it, then cracked the device’s encryption and [last month made _Clone Home_ available for anyone to download.](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-long-lost-ratchet-and-clank-mobile-game-has-been-found-123008739.html)
