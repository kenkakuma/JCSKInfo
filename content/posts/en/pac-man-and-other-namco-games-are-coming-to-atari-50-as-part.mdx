[_Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration_](https://www.engadget.com/ataris-50th-anniversary-collection-is-getting-a-hefty-update-with-nearly-40-additional-games-150827022.html) is a fascinating journey through the history of Atari, but that timeline couldn't be truly rounded without the inclusion of some Namco classics like _Pac-Man_ and _Galaga_. To remedy that, Atari and developer Digital Eclipse are releasing another paid expansion for the retro collection. It’s called The Namco Legendary Pack and it will be available on November 13 on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Steam for $8.

The DLC adds a new interactive timeline that will take you through the history of Namco games on Atari systems, with the help of video interviews with developers and archival materials including photos and other documents. The expansion features versions of _Pac-Man_ for Atari 2600, Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit. _Pac-Man_ was the best-selling game on Atari 2600, but it's safe to say that version doesn't exactly hold up. 

The Namco Legendary Pack also includes the US arcade versions of _Dig Dug_ and _Xevius._ In addition, you’ll get home console versions of those two games, _Galaga_ and _Galaxian_.

The DLC will make _Atari 50_ even more of a comprehensive overview of the company's history. An expansion that arrived last November [charted the rivalry](https://www.engadget.com/gaming/atari-50s-console-war-expansion-adds-19-more-games-on-november-8-181033645.html) between Atari and Intellivision, aka the first console war. Atari finally brought that to a decisive end when it [bought the Intellivision brand](https://www.engadget.com/atari-just-bought-intellivision-putting-an-end-to-the-very-first-console-war-172320606.html) last year.
