If you're looking to get fit, sleep better or just keep a closer eye on your health, a fitness wearable is a great place to start. Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. Some are even subtle enough to wear 24/7, like smart rings, while others double as stylish smartwatches.  
  
There are great options out there for beginners as well as more advanced users, and the variety of features means there’s something for every lifestyle and budget. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the best fitness trackers you can buy right now, and explain who each one is best suited for.

## Best fitness trackers for 2026

## What do fitness trackers do best?

The answer seems simple: Fitness wearables are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands and smart rings have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, better battery life, durability and price.

When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their advanced health tracking abilities — things like all-day resting heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, and even detailed sleep tracker insights. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous gadget on their wrists all day.

Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled. Many fitness trackers also slot nicely into your existing ecosystem, syncing seamlessly with your smartphone, other fitness apps and cloud storage to keep all your data in one place.

When it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid smart band starting at $70. That makes them a great entry point for beginners who want to track their progress without committing to a full smartwatch. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.

## When to get a smartwatch instead

If you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems.

But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.

If you’re someone who’s seriously training — say for a race or an endurance challenge — a dedicated [running watch](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html) may be worth considering. These often provide more in-depth cardio analytics, recovery insights, and real-time pace data that go beyond what standard trackers can deliver.

## Other fitness trackers we've tested

### Fitbit Inspire 3

The [Fitbit Inspire 3](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0B5F9SZW7&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=4ad1be40-0a29-3f30-89c3-c8f1a9034ccf&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=Fitbit+Inspire+3&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3Byb2R1Y3QvQjBCNUY5U1pXNy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGFkMWJlNDAtMGEyOS0zZjMwLTg5YzMtYzhmMWE5MDM0Y2NmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3Byb2R1Y3QvQjBCNUY5U1pXNy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&signature=AQAAARHIWeWv1k4s-rv5W8ueWMXVZMfPBnooGdsQbkdy4H8V&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B5F9SZW7%2F) strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 6 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go.

## Fitness tracker FAQs

### How long do fitness tracker batteries last?

The battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you're using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you'll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you'll extend battery life.
