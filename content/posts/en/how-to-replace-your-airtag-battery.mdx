[Apple’s AirTag](https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-new-airtag-still-doesnt-have-a-keyring-hole-150540254.html) is designed to run quietly in the background, helping you keep track of [everyday items like keys, bags and luggage](https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html). Unlike many small trackers, an AirTag doesn’t need to be charged. Instead, it uses a standard replaceable coin cell battery that typically lasts around a year, depending on usage.

When the battery runs low, your iPhone will alert you. Replacing it is a simple process that takes just a few minutes and doesn’t require any tools. This guide explains how to tell when your AirTag battery needs replacing, which battery to use and how to swap it safely.

## How to replace the battery in your AirTag

Replacing the battery only takes a few steps.

1.  Hold the AirTag with the polished stainless steel side facing up. 
    
2.  Press down firmly on the metal battery cover and rotate it counterclockwise. Continue turning until the cover stops moving.
    
3.  Lift off the cover and remove the old battery.
    
4.  Insert a new [CR2032 battery](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&itemId=amazon_B0787K2XWZ&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=b805838c-65ab-4661-8dc2-975de9900fc6&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Amazon&linkText=CR2032+battery&custData=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&signature=AQAAAd7ZQapWpiJiYoXbzvBQ0OZd_GsOAeBoWceYFPS-b44A&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Basics-CR2032-Compatible-Mercury-Free%2Fdp%2FB0787K2XWZ%2F) with the positive (+) side facing up. Once the battery is seated correctly, the AirTag will emit a brief chime, confirming that power has been restored.
    
5.  Place the battery cover back onto the AirTag. Align the three small tabs on the cover with the matching slots on the AirTag body.
    
6.  Press down gently and rotate the cover clockwise until it stops. The cover should sit flush with the AirTag and feel secure once locked into place.
    

No pairing or setup steps are required after replacing the battery. Your AirTag will automatically reconnect to your Apple ID.

## When to replace your AirTag battery

Your iPhone will automatically notify you when an AirTag battery is running low. The alert appears as a notification and doesn’t interrupt tracking, but it’s a good idea to replace the battery quickly to avoid losing location updates.

If you’re unsure whether your AirTag battery needs replacing, open the **Find My app**, tap the **Items** tab and select your **AirTag**. If a message appears under the AirTag name stating “Low Battery”, you’ll know it needs replacing. If no message appears, it’s safe to assume the battery level is fine for now. AirTags don’t have a screen or any other battery indicator, but Apple does show a battery percentage for AirTags in the FindMy app. The low battery warning is the only signal Apple provides before replacement becomes necessary.

## What to do if your AirTag doesn’t make a sound

If you don’t hear a sound after inserting the new battery, remove it and check that it’s oriented correctly with the positive side facing up. You should also secure the back cover onto the AirTag as well, to see if the chime sounds after that.

If the battery is oriented properly and still doesn’t trigger a sound, try a different CR2032 battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 lithium 3V coin battery, a common type available at most electronics stores, supermarkets and pharmacies. Some batteries, particularly those with thick coatings, may not make consistent contact. Apple suggests looking for packaging that states “Compatible with AirTag.” Once a working battery is installed, the AirTag should resume normal operation immediately.

## How often should you replace your AirTag battery

Most AirTag batteries last about a year under typical use. Frequent use of Precision Finding, sound playback or location updates may reduce battery life. iOS will notify you before the battery is fully depleted, so there’s no need to replace it preemptively unless you’re preparing for long-term travel or storage.

Used coin batteries should not be thrown in household trash. Many retailers and recycling centers accept lithium batteries for proper disposal. Check local recycling guidelines for battery drop-off locations. Storing used batteries in a secure container until they can be recycled helps reduce the risk of accidental contact or ingestion.

Replacing an AirTag battery is one of the simplest maintenance tasks Apple devices require. With a readily available battery and no tools involved, most users can complete the process in under a minute. As long as you pay attention to low battery notifications and follow basic safety precautions, your AirTag should continue tracking your belongings reliably with minimal effort.
